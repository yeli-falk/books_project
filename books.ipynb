      "Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the\n",
      "vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions,\n",
      "though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering\n",
      "along with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a\n",
      "coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.\n",
      "It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a\n",
      "man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome\n",
      "features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even\n",
      "at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric\n",
      "current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive\n",
      "in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston,\n",
      "who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went\n",
      "slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the\n",
      "lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was\n",
      "one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about\n",
      "when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had\n",
      "something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an\n",
      "oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface\n",
      "of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank\n",
      "somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument\n",
      "(the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of\n",
      "shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail\n",
      "figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls\n",
      "which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face\n",
      "naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor\n",
      "blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in\n",
      "the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into\n",
      "spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there\n",
      "seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered\n",
      "everywhere. The black-moustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding\n",
      "corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER\n",
      "IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into\n",
      "Winston's own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner,\n",
      "flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the\n",
      "single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between\n",
      "the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again\n",
      "with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's\n",
      "windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police\n",
      "mattered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away\n",
      "about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The\n",
      "telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston\n",
      "made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it,\n",
      "moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal\n",
      "plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course\n",
      "no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How\n",
      "often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual\n",
      "wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all\n",
      "the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted\n",
      "to. You had to live--did live, from habit that became instinct--in the\n",
      "assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in\n",
      "darkness, every movement scrutinized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer; though, as he\n",
      "well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of\n",
      "Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape.\n",
      "This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste--this was London, chief\n",
      "city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of\n",
      "Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him\n",
      "whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these\n",
      "vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with\n",
      "baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs\n",
      "with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions?\n",
      "And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the\n",
      "willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the\n",
      "bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies\n",
      "of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not\n",
      "remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit\n",
      "tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Truth--Minitrue, in Newspeak [Newspeak was the official\n",
      "language of Oceania. For an account of its structure and etymology see\n",
      "Appendix.]--was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It\n",
      "was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring\n",
      "up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston\n",
      "stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in\n",
      "elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  WAR IS PEACE\n",
      "  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY\n",
      "  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above\n",
      "ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London\n",
      "there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. So\n",
      "completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof\n",
      "of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. They\n",
      "were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus\n",
      "of government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself\n",
      "with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry of\n",
      "Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which\n",
      "maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible\n",
      "for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv,\n",
      "and Miniplenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There were no windows\n",
      "in it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor\n",
      "within half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter except\n",
      "on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of\n",
      "barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. Even\n",
      "the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced\n",
      "guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the\n",
      "expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing\n",
      "the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving\n",
      "the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the\n",
      "canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except\n",
      "a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's\n",
      "breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid\n",
      "with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily\n",
      "smell, as of Chinese rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful,\n",
      "nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The\n",
      "stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the\n",
      "sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The\n",
      "next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world\n",
      "began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet\n",
      "marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the\n",

      "He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood\n",
      "to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a\n",

      "red back and a marbled cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual\n",
      "position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where\n",
      "it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the\n",
      "window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston\n",
      "was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been\n",
      "intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well\n",
      "back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so\n",
      "far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed\n",
      "in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual\n",
      "geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now\n",
      "about to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of\n",
      "the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper,\n",
      "a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for\n",
      "at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much\n",
      "older than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little\n",
      "junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not\n",
      "now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire\n",
      "to possess it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops\n",
      "('dealing on the free market', it was called), but the rule was not\n",
      "strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and\n",
      "razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He\n",
      "had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside\n",
      "and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious\n",
      "of wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home\n",
      "in his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising\n",
      "possession.\n",

      "The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal\n",

      "it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least\n",
      "by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into\n",
      "the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic\n",
      "instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one,\n",
      "furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the\n",
      "beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead\n",
      "of being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to writing\n",
      "by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything\n",
      "into the speak-write which was of course impossible for his present\n",
      "purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a\n",
      "second. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the\n",
      "decisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:\n",

      "begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984. It\n",
      "must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was\n",
      "thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but\n",

      "forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks\n",
      "past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed\n",
      "his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing\n",
      "would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable\n",
      "restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for\n",
      "years. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up. Moreover\n",
      "his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not scratch it,\n",
      "because if he did so it always became inflamed. The seconds were ticking\n",
      "by. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front\n",

      "Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what\n",

      "in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for\n",
      "the Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of the\n",

      "to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often\n",
      "passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she\n",
      "worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably--since he had sometimes seen\n",
      "her with oily hands and carrying a spanner--she had some mechanical job\n",
      "on one of the novel-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, of\n",
      "about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic\n",
      "movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was\n",
      "wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to\n",
      "bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the\n",
      "very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the\n",
      "atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general\n",
      "clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked\n",
      "nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always\n",
      "the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted\n",
      "adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and\n",
      "nosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression\n",
      "of being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor\n",
      "she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into\n",
      "him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even\n",
      "crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That,\n",
      "it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar\n",
      "uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever\n",
      "she was anywhere near him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and\n",
      "holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim\n",
      "idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people\n",
      "round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member\n",
      "approaching. O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse,\n",
      "humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he had a\n",
      "certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on\n",
      "his nose which was curiously disarming--in some indefinable way, curiously\n",
      "civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such\n",
      "terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his\n",
      "snuffbox. Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many\n",
      "years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued\n",
      "by the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter's\n",
      "physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief--or perhaps\n",
      "not even a belief, merely a hope--that O'Brien's political orthodoxy was\n",
      "not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And again,\n",
      "perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but\n",
      "simply intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a\n",
      "person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and\n",
      "get him alone. Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this\n",
      "guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. At this moment O'Brien glanced\n",
      "at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently\n",
      "decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was\n",
      "over. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away.\n",
      "A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was\n",
      "between them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next moment a hideous, grinding screech, as of some monstrous machine\n",
      "running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room.\n",
      "It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the\n",
      "back of one's neck. The Hate had started.\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had\n",
      "flashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among the\n",
      "audience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and\n",
      "disgust. Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago\n",
      "(how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading\n",
      "figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and\n",
      "then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned\n",
      "to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes\n",
      "of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in\n",
      "which Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor,\n",
      "the earliest defiler of the Party's purity. All subsequent crimes against\n",
      "the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations,\n",
      "sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still\n",
      "alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea,\n",
      "under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even--so it was\n",
      "occasionally rumoured--in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of\n",
      "Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face,\n",
      "with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard--a\n",
      "clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile\n",
      "silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles\n",
      "was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a\n",
      "sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack\n",
      "upon the doctrines of the Party--an attack so exaggerated and perverse that\n",
      "a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible\n",
      "enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less\n",
      "level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big\n",
      "Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding\n",
      "the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom\n",
      "of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought,\n",
      "he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed--and all\n",
      "this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the\n",
      "habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak\n",
      "words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally\n",
      "use in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to\n",
      "the reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on\n",
      "the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army--row\n",
      "after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam\n",
      "up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others\n",
      "exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the\n",
      "background to Goldstein's bleating voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable\n",
      "exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room.\n",
      "The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power\n",
      "of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides,\n",
      "the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger\n",
      "automatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia\n",
      "or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was\n",
      "generally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that although\n",
      "Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a\n",
      "thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers,\n",
      "in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the\n",
      "general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were--in spite of all this,\n",
      "his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes\n",
      "waiting to be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteurs\n",
      "acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police.\n",
      "He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of\n",
      "conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, its\n",
      "name was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terrible\n",
      "book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author\n",
      "and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a\n",
      "title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But one knew\n",
      "of such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor\n",
      "THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if\n",
      "there was a way of avoiding it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People were leaping up and\n",
      "down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort\n",
      "to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. The little\n",
      "sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and\n",
      "shutting like that of a landed fish. Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed.\n",
      "He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and\n",
      "quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The\n",
      "dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine! Swine! Swine!'\n",
      "and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the\n",
      "screen. It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued\n",
      "inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the\n",
      "others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The\n",
      "horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to\n",
      "act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining\n",
      "in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous\n",
      "ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash\n",
      "faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of\n",
      "people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into\n",
      "a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an\n",
      "abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to\n",
      "another like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston's hatred\n",
      "was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against\n",
      "Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his\n",
      "heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian\n",
      "of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he\n",
      "was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein\n",
      "seemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Big\n",
      "Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an\n",
      "invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes\n",
      "of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and\n",
      "the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister\n",
      "enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure\n",
      "of civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or that\n",
      "by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one\n",
      "wrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded\n",
      "in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired\n",
      "girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.\n",
      "He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked\n",
      "to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would\n",
      "ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before,\n",
      "moreover, he realized WHY it was that he hated her. He hated her because\n",
      "she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with\n",
      "her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which\n",
      "seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious\n",
      "scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had become an actual\n",
      "sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep.\n",
      "Then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed\n",
      "to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and\n",
      "seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the\n",
      "people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. But\n",
      "in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the\n",
      "hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired,\n",
      "black-moustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that\n",
      "it almost filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.\n",
      "It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are\n",
      "uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but\n",
      "restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big\n",
      "Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood\n",
      "out in bold capitals:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  WAR IS PEACE\n",
      "  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY\n",
      "  IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the\n",
      "screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was\n",
      "too vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandy-haired woman had flung\n",
      "herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a\n",
      "tremulous murmur that sounded like 'My Saviour!' she extended her arms\n",
      "towards the screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent\n",
      "that she was uttering a prayer.\n",
      "\n",

      "long pause between the first 'B' and the second--a heavy, murmurous sound,\n",
      "somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the\n",
      "stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as much as\n",
      "thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in\n",
      "moments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom\n",
      "and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis,\n",
      "a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.\n",
      "Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could\n",
      "not help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of\n",
      "'B-B!...B-B!' always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with the\n",
      "rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, to\n",
      "control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive\n",
      "reaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the\n",
      "expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. And it was\n",
      "exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened--if, indeed,\n",
      "it did happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye. O'Brien had stood up. He had taken\n",
      "off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with\n",
      "his characteristic gesture. But there was a fraction of a second when\n",
      "their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew--yes, he\n",
      "KNEW!--that O'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable\n",
      "message had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the\n",
      "thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. 'I am\n",
      "with you,' O'Brien seemed to be saying to him. 'I know precisely what you\n",
      "are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust.\n",
      "But don't worry, I am on your side!' And then the flash of intelligence\n",
      "was gone, and O'Brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Such\n",
      "incidents never had any sequel. All that they did was to keep alive in him\n",
      "the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the\n",
      "Party. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after\n",
      "all--perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spite\n",
      "of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the\n",
      "Brotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days\n",
      "not. There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything\n",
      "or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory\n",
      "walls--once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand\n",
      "which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was all\n",
      "guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. He had gone back to his\n",
      "cubicle without looking at O'Brien again. The idea of following up their\n",
      "momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably\n",
      "dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a second, two\n",
      "seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of\n",

      "Committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community\n",
      "hikes, spontaneous demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntary\n",

      "agonizingly painful blow. It was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed\n",

      "\n",
      "Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the\n",
      "table again, still rubbing his neck. The music from the telescreen had\n",
      "stopped. Instead, a clipped military voice was reading out, with a sort of\n",
      "brutal relish, a description of the armaments of the new Floating Fortress\n",
      "which had just been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands.\n",

      "and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays were\n",
      "horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as\n",
      "the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages,\n",
      "and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the\n",

      "everything connected with it. The songs, the processions, the banners, the\n",
      "hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship\n",
      "of Big Brother--it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All their\n",
      "ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against\n",
      "foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal\n",
      "for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. And with\n",
      "good reason, for hardly a week passed in which 'The Times' did not carry\n",
      "a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak--'child hero'\n",

      "and denounced its parents to the Thought Police.\n",

      "The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He picked up his pen\n",
      "half-heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to write\n",

      "\n",
      "Years ago--how long was it? Seven years it must be--he had dreamed that he\n",

      "darkness.' It was said very quietly, almost casually--a statement, not a\n",
      "command. He had walked on without pausing. What was curious was that at the\n",
      "time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. It was\n",
      "only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. He\n",
      "could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that\n",
      "he had seen O'Brien for the first time, nor could he remember when he had\n",
      "first identified the voice as O'Brien's. But at any rate the identification\n",
      "existed. It was O'Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston had never been able to feel sure--even after this morning's flash\n",
      "of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether O'Brien was a friend\n",
      "or an enemy. Nor did it even seem to matter greatly. There was a link of\n",
      "understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship.\n",
      "'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' he had said.\n",
      "Winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another it\n",
      "would come true.\n",

      "'Attention! Your attention, please! A newsflash has this moment arrived\n",

      "the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty.\n",

      "\n",
      "He must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had\n",
      "disappeared. She was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow\n",
      "movements and magnificent fair hair. His father he remembered more vaguely\n",
      "as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston remembered\n",
      "especially the very thin soles of his father's shoes) and wearing\n",
      "spectacles. The two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one\n",
      "of the first great purges of the fifties.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him,\n",
      "with his young sister in her arms. He did not remember his sister at all,\n",
      "except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes.\n",
      "Both of them were looking up at him. They were down in some subterranean\n",
      "place--the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave--but it\n",
      "was a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards.\n",
      "They were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the\n",
      "darkening water. There was still air in the saloon, they could still see\n",
      "him and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into the\n",
      "green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever.\n",
      "He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death,\n",
      "and they were down there because he was up here. He knew it and they knew\n",
      "it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces. There was no reproach\n",
      "either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they\n",
      "must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part of\n",
      "the unavoidable order of things.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that in\n",
      "some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his\n",
      "own. It was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic\n",
      "dream scenery, are a continuation of one's intellectual life, and in which\n",
      "one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable\n",
      "after one is awake. The thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that his\n",
      "mother's death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in\n",
      "a way that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the\n",
      "ancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love, and friendship,\n",
      "and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to\n",
      "know the reason. His mother's memory tore at his heart because she had died\n",
      "loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and\n",
      "because somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a\n",
      "conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, he\n",
      "saw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but\n",
      "no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All this he seemed to\n",
      "see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him\n",
      "through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening when\n",
      "the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground. The landscape that he was\n",
      "looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain\n",
      "whether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts he\n",
      "called it the Golden Country. It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a\n",
      "foot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged\n",
      "hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were\n",
      "swaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense\n",
      "masses like women's hair. Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight,\n",
      "there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the\n",
      "pools under the willow trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field. With\n",
      "what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them\n",
      "disdainfully aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire\n",
      "in him, indeed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instant\n",
      "was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside.\n",
      "With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture,\n",
      "a whole system of thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and the\n",
      "Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid\n",

      "a member of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually,\n",
      "and a suit of pyjamas was 600--and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of\n",
      "shorts that were lying across a chair. The Physical Jerks would begin in\n",
      "three minutes. The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit\n",
      "which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied his lungs\n",
      "so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back\n",
      "and taking a series of deep gasps. His veins had swelled with the effort of\n",

      "restored it somewhat. As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth,\n",
      "wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper\n",
      "during the Physical Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into\n",
      "the dim period of his early childhood. It was extraordinarily difficult.\n",
      "Beyond the late fifties everything faded. When there were no external\n",
      "records that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost\n",
      "its sharpness. You remembered huge events which had quite probably not\n",
      "happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to\n",
      "recapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you\n",
      "could assign nothing. Everything had been different then. Even the names of\n",
      "countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One,\n",
      "for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called\n",

      "Winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been\n",

      "raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the time\n",

      "hurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and round\n",
      "a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied\n",
      "his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest. His\n",

      "the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the\n",
      "present controls the past.' And yet the past, though of its nature\n",
      "alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from\n",

      "then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process\n",

      "how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every\n",
      "quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps\n",
      "half the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every\n",

      "'A very inadequate substitute,' said Syme.\n",

      "to say, 'I see through you. I know very well why you didn't go to see\n",
      "those prisoners hanged.' In an intellectual way, Syme was venomously\n",
      "orthodox. He would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of\n",
      "helicopter raids on enemy villages, and trials and confessions of\n",
      "thought-criminals, the executions in the cellars of the Ministry of Love.\n",
      "Talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects\n",
      "and entangling him, if possible, in the technicalities of Newspeak, on\n",
      "which he was authoritative and interesting. Winston turned his head a\n",
      "little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was a good hanging,' said Syme reminiscently. 'I think it spoils it\n",
      "when they tie their feet together. I like to see them kicking. And above\n",
      "all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue--a quite bright\n",
      "blue. That's the detail that appeals to me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Nex', please!' yelled the white-aproned prole with the ladle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. On to each was\n",
      "dumped swiftly the regulation lunch--a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew,\n",
      "a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milkless Victory Coffee, and\n",
      "one saccharine tablet.\n",
      "\n",

      "up a gin on the way.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. They threaded\n",
      "their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the\n",
      "metal-topped table, on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew,\n",
      "a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winston took up his\n",
      "mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the\n",
      "oily-tasting stuff down. When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he\n",
      "suddenly discovered that he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls of\n",
      "the stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy\n",
      "pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat. Neither of them\n",
      "spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins. From the table at\n",
      "Winston's left, a little behind his back, someone was talking rapidly and\n",
      "continuously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck, which\n",
      "pierced the general uproar of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How is the Dictionary getting on?' said Winston, raising his voice to\n",
      "overcome the noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Slowly,' said Syme. 'I'm on the adjectives. It's fascinating.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He had brightened up immediately at the mention of Newspeak. He pushed his\n",
      "pannikin aside, took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his\n",
      "cheese in the other, and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak\n",
      "without shouting.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition,' he said. 'We're getting\n",
      "the language into its final shape--the shape it's going to have when nobody\n",
      "speaks anything else. When we've finished with it, people like you will\n",
      "have to learn it all over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job\n",
      "is inventing new words. But not a bit of it! We're destroying words--scores\n",
      "of them, hundreds of them, every day. We're cutting the language down to\n",
      "the bone. The Eleventh Edition won't contain a single word that will become\n",
      "obsolete before the year 2050.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, then\n",
      "continued speaking, with a sort of pedant's passion. His thin dark face\n",
      "had become animated, his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown\n",
      "almost dreamy.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great\n",
      "wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns\n",
      "that can be got rid of as well. It isn't only the synonyms; there are also\n",
      "the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is\n",
      "simply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in\n",
      "itself. Take \"good\", for instance. If you have a word like \"good\", what\n",
      "need is there for a word like \"bad\"? \"Ungood\" will do just as well--better,\n",
      "because it's an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you\n",
      "want a stronger version of \"good\", what sense is there in having a whole\n",
      "string of vague useless words like \"excellent\" and \"splendid\" and all the\n",
      "rest of them? \"Plusgood\" covers the meaning, or \"doubleplusgood\" if you\n",
      "want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already. but\n",
      "in the final version of Newspeak there'll be nothing else. In the end the\n",
      "whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words--in\n",
      "reality, only one word. Don't you see the beauty of that, Winston? It was\n",
      "B.B.'s idea originally, of course,' he added as an afterthought.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sort of vapid eagerness flitted across Winston's face at the mention of\n",
      "Big Brother. Nevertheless Syme immediately detected a certain lack of\n",
      "enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You haven't a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston,' he said almost\n",
      "sadly. 'Even when you write it you're still thinking in Oldspeak. I've read\n",
      "some of those pieces that you write in \"The Times\" occasionally. They're\n",
      "good enough, but they're translations. In your heart you'd prefer to stick\n",
      "to Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning.\n",
      "You don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. Do you know that\n",
      "Newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller\n",
      "every year?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not\n",
      "trusting himself to speak. Syme bit off another fragment of the\n",
      "dark-coloured bread, chewed it briefly, and went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of\n",
      "thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible,\n",
      "because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that\n",
      "can ever be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning\n",
      "rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten.\n",
      "Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we're not far from that point. But the\n",
      "process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year\n",
      "fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little\n",
      "smaller. Even now, of course, there's no reason or excuse for committing\n",
      "thoughtcrime. It's merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control.\n",
      "But in the end there won't be any need even for that. The Revolution will\n",
      "be complete when the language is perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc\n",
      "is Newspeak,' he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. 'Has it ever\n",
      "occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a\n",
      "single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation\n",
      "as we are having now?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Except----' began Winston doubtfully, and he stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been on the tip of his tongue to say 'Except the proles,' but he\n",
      "checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in\n",
      "some way unorthodox. Syme, however, had divined what he was about to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The proles are not human beings,' he said carelessly. 'By 2050--earlier,\n",
      "probably--all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared. The whole\n",
      "literature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare,\n",
      "Milton, Byron--they'll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed\n",
      "into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory\n",
      "of what they used to be. Even the literature of the Party will change.\n",
      "Even the slogans will change. How could you have a slogan like \"freedom is\n",
      "slavery\" when the concept of freedom has been abolished? The whole climate\n",
      "of thought will be different. In fact there will be no thought, as we\n",
      "understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think.\n",
      "Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.'\n",
      "\n",
      "One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep conviction, Syme will\n",
      "be vaporized. He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too\n",
      "plainly. The Party does not like such people. One day he will disappear.\n",
      "It is written in his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston had finished his bread and cheese. He turned a little sideways\n",
      "in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. At the table on his left the man\n",
      "with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. A young\n",
      "woman who was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back\n",
      "to Winston, was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with\n",
      "everything that he said. From time to time Winston caught some such remark\n",
      "as 'I think you're so right, I do so agree with you', uttered in a youthful\n",
      "and rather silly feminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an\n",
      "instant, even when the girl was speaking. Winston knew the man by sight,\n",
      "though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post\n",
      "in the Fiction Department. He was a man of about thirty, with a muscular\n",
      "throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, and\n",
      "because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the\n",
      "light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. What was\n",
      "slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out of\n",
      "his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just\n",
      "once Winston caught a phrase--'complete and final elimination of\n",
      "Goldsteinism'--jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece,\n",
      "like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it was just a noise, a\n",
      "quack-quack-quacking. And yet, though you could not actually hear what the\n",
      "man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature.\n",
      "He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against\n",
      "thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the\n",
      "atrocities of the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the\n",
      "heroes on the Malabar front--it made no difference. Whatever it was, you\n",
      "could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc.\n",
      "As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down,\n",
      "Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but\n",
      "some kind of dummy. It was not the man's brain that was speaking, it was\n",
      "his larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but\n",
      "it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in\n",
      "unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was\n",
      "tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. The voice from the other table\n",
      "quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There is a word in Newspeak,' said Syme, 'I don't know whether you know\n",
      "it: DUCKSPEAK, to quack like a duck. It is one of those interesting words\n",
      "that have two contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it is abuse,\n",
      "applied to someone you agree with, it is praise.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought again. He thought\n",
      "it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that Syme despised him\n",
      "and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a\n",
      "thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There was something\n",
      "subtly wrong with Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion,\n",
      "aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. You could not say that he was\n",
      "unorthodox. He believed in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big\n",
      "Brother, he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely with\n",
      "sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness of\n",
      "information, which the ordinary Party member did not approach. Yet a faint\n",
      "air of disreputability always clung to him. He said things that would have\n",
      "been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented the Chestnut\n",
      "Tree Cafe, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law, not even an\n",
      "unwritten law, against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Cafe, yet the place\n",
      "was somehow ill-omened. The old, discredited leaders of the Party had been\n",
      "used to gather there before they were finally purged. Goldstein himself,\n",
      "it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. Syme's\n",
      "fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet it was a fact that if Syme\n",
      "grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, Winston's, secret\n",
      "opinions, he would betray him instantly to the Thought Police. So would\n",
      "anybody else, for that matter: but Syme more than most. Zeal was not\n",
      "enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Syme looked up. 'Here comes Parsons,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, 'that bloody fool'.\n",
      "Parsons, Winston's fellow-tenant at Victory Mansions, was in fact threading\n",
      "his way across the room--a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a\n",
      "froglike face. At thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at\n",
      "neck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. His whole\n",
      "appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much so that although\n",
      "he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not to\n",
      "think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red\n",
      "neckerchief of the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always a picture of\n",
      "dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons did,\n",
      "indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other\n",
      "physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. He greeted them both\n",
      "with a cheery 'Hullo, hullo!' and sat down at the table, giving off an\n",
      "intense smell of sweat. Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face.\n",
      "His powers of sweating were extraordinary. At the Community Centre you\n",
      "could always tell when he had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of\n",
      "the bat handle. Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a\n",
      "long column of words, and was studying it with an ink-pencil between his\n",
      "fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Look at him working away in the lunch hour,' said Parsons, nudging\n",
      "Winston. 'Keenness, eh? What's that you've got there, old boy? Something\n",
      "a bit too brainy for me, I expect. Smith, old boy, I'll tell you why I'm\n",
      "chasing you. It's that sub you forgot to give me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Which sub is that?' said Winston, automatically feeling for money. About\n",
      "a quarter of one's salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions,\n",
      "which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "'For Hate Week. You know--the house-by-house fund. I'm treasurer for our\n",
      "block. We're making an all-out effort--going to put on a tremendous show.\n",
      "I tell you, it won't be my fault if old Victory Mansions doesn't have the\n",
      "biggest outfit of flags in the whole street. Two dollars you promised me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes, which Parsons\n",
      "entered in a small notebook, in the neat handwriting of the illiterate.\n",
      "\n",
      "'By the way, old boy,' he said. 'I hear that little beggar of mine let fly\n",
      "at you with his catapult yesterday. I gave him a good dressing-down for it.\n",
      "In fact I told him I'd take the catapult away if he does it again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,' said\n",
      "Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, well--what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn't it?\n",
      "Mischievous little beggars they are, both of them, but talk about keenness!\n",
      "All they think about is the Spies, and the war, of course. D'you know what\n",
      "that little girl of mine did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hike\n",
      "out Berkhamsted way? She got two other girls to go with her, slipped off\n",
      "from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man. They\n",
      "kept on his tail for two hours, right through the woods, and then, when\n",
      "they got into Amersham, handed him over to the patrols.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What did they do that for?' said Winston, somewhat taken aback. Parsons\n",
      "went on triumphantly:\n",
      "\n",
      "'My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent--might have been dropped\n",
      "by parachute, for instance. But here's the point, old boy. What do you\n",
      "think put her on to him in the first place? She spotted he was wearing a\n",
      "funny kind of shoes--said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like that\n",
      "before. So the chances were he was a foreigner. Pretty smart for a nipper\n",
      "of seven, eh?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What happened to the man?' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, that I couldn't say, of course. But I wouldn't be altogether surprised\n",
      "if----' Parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle, and clicked his tongue\n",
      "for the explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good,' said Syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course we can't afford to take chances,' agreed Winston dutifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What I mean to say, there is a war on,' said Parsons.\n",
      "\n",
      "As though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from the\n",
      "telescreen just above their heads. However, it was not the proclamation of\n",
      "a military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the Ministry\n",
      "of Plenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Comrades!' cried an eager youthful voice. 'Attention, comrades! We have\n",
      "glorious news for you. We have won the battle for production! Returns now\n",
      "completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the\n",
      "standard of living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past\n",
      "year. All over Oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous\n",
      "demonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices and\n",
      "paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to Big\n",
      "Brother for the new, happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed\n",
      "upon us. Here are some of the completed figures. Foodstuffs----'\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrase 'our new, happy life' recurred several times. It had been a\n",
      "favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Parsons, his attention\n",
      "caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity,\n",
      "a sort of edified boredom. He could not follow the figures, but he was\n",
      "aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged\n",
      "out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco.\n",
      "With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to\n",
      "fill a pipe to the top. Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he\n",
      "held carefully horizontal. The new ration did not start till tomorrow and\n",
      "he had only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his ears to\n",
      "the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the\n",
      "telescreen. It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank\n",
      "Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And\n",
      "only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was\n",
      "to be REDUCED to twenty grammes a week. Was it possible that they could\n",
      "swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons\n",
      "swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature\n",
      "at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious\n",
      "desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that\n",
      "last week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too--in some more\n",
      "complex way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, ALONE\n",
      "in the possession of a memory?\n",
      "\n",
      "The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. As\n",
      "compared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses,\n",
      "more furniture, more cooking-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters,\n",
      "more books, more babies--more of everything except disease, crime, and\n",
      "insanity. Year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was\n",
      "whizzing rapidly upwards. As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up\n",
      "his spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across\n",
      "the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. He meditated\n",
      "resentfully on the physical texture of life. Had it always been like\n",
      "this? Had food always tasted like this? He looked round the canteen.\n",
      "A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of\n",
      "innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close\n",
      "together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays,\n",
      "coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a\n",
      "sourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and\n",
      "dirty clothes. Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort\n",
      "of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had\n",
      "a right to. It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly\n",
      "different. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never\n",

      "Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system. At any moment\n",

      "back; a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-five to\n",
      "forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case. They were a few metres\n",

      "only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but\n",
      "obviously habitual. He remembered thinking at the time: That poor devil is\n",
      "done for. And what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly\n",
      "unconscious. The most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. There\n",

      "break. It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To be\n",

      "not more, if you had committed no other offence. And it was easy enough,\n",

      "the impression of being physically attracted to one another. The only\n",
      "recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of\n",

      "minor operation, like having an enema. This again was never put into plain\n",

      "\n",
      "Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid\n",

      "noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing\n",
      "behind it. Very early in her married life he had decided--though perhaps\n",
      "it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people--that\n",
      "she had without exception the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that he had\n",
      "ever encountered. She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan,\n",
      "and there was no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable of\n",
      "swallowing if the Party handed it out to her. 'The human sound-track' he\n",

      "if it had not been for just one thing--sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen. To embrace her\n",

      "even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she\n",
      "was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The rigidity\n",
      "of her muscles managed to convey that impression. She would lie there\n",
      "with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but SUBMITTING. It was\n",
      "extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even then\n",
      "he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should\n",
      "remain celibate. But curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this.\n",
      "They must, she said, produce a child if they could. So the performance\n",
      "continued to happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was not\n",
      "impossible. She even used to remind him of it in the morning, as something\n",
      "which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten. She had\n",
      "two names for it. One was 'making a baby', and the other was 'our duty to\n",
      "the Party' (yes, she had actually used that phrase). Quite soon he grew to\n",
      "have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round. But\n",

      "from bondage. Before the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by\n",

      "to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a\n",

      "desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that\n",
      "was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to\n",
      "whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or\n",
      "shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes\n",
      "did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas,\n",
      "they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils\n",
      "invariably escaped their notice. The great majority of proles did not even\n",
      "have telescreens in their homes. Even the civil police interfered with them\n",
      "very little. There was a vast amount of criminality in London, a whole\n",
      "world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, and\n",
      "racketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles\n",
      "themselves, it was of no importance. In all questions of morals they were\n",
      "allowed to follow their ancestral code. The sexual puritanism of the\n",
      "Party was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity went unpunished, divorce\n",
      "was permitted. For that matter, even religious worship would have been\n",
      "permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it.\n",

      "men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page.\n",
      "You can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a\n",

      "everyone else was their slave. They owned all the land, all the houses,\n",
      "all the factories, and all the money. If anyone disobeyed them they could\n",
      "throw them into prison, or they could take his job away and starve him to\n",
      "death. When any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and\n",

      "listlessness. Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only\n",
      "to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals\n",
      "that the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even for a Party\n",

      "falsification. He had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty\n",
      "seconds. In 1973, it must have been--at any rate, it was at about the time\n",
      "when he and Katharine had parted. But the really relevant date was seven\n",

      "The story really began in the middle sixties, the period of the great\n",

      "counter-revolutionaries. Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew\n",
      "where, and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majority\n",
      "had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made\n",
      "confession of their crimes. Among the last survivors were three men named\n",
      "Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. It must have been in 1965 that these three\n",
      "had been arrested. As often happened, they had vanished for a year or more,\n",
      "so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had\n",
      "suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way.\n",
      "They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the\n",
      "enemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various\n",
      "trusted Party members, intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother\n",
      "which had started long before the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage\n",
      "causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people. After confessing to\n",
      "these things they had been pardoned, reinstated in the Party, and given\n",
      "posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important. All three\n",

      "for their defection and promising to make amends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some time after their release Winston had actually seen all three of them\n",
      "in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. He remembered the sort of terrified fascination\n",
      "with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye. They were men\n",
      "far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great\n",
      "figures left over from the heroic days of the Party. The glamour of the\n",
      "underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them. He had\n",
      "the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing\n",
      "blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that\n",
      "of Big Brother. But also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed\n",
      "with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two. No one who had\n",
      "once fallen into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end.\n",
      "They were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It was not wise\n",
      "even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people. They were sitting\n",
      "in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the\n",
      "speciality of the cafe. Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance\n",
      "had most impressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist,\n",
      "whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and\n",
      "during the Revolution. Even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were\n",
      "appearing in The Times. They were simply an imitation of his earlier\n",
      "manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. Always they were a\n",
      "rehashing of the ancient themes--slum tenements, starving children, street\n",
      "battles, capitalists in top hats--even on the barricades the capitalists\n",
      "still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless, hopeless effort to\n",
      "get back into the past. He was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy\n",
      "grey hair, his face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips. At one\n",
      "time he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging,\n",
      "sloping, bulging, falling away in every direction. He seemed to be breaking\n",
      "up before one's eyes, like a mountain crumbling.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could not now remember how he\n",
      "had come to be in the cafe at such a time. The place was almost empty. A\n",
      "tinny music was trickling from the telescreens. The three men sat in their\n",
      "corner almost motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded, the waiter brought\n",
      "fresh glasses of gin. There was a chessboard on the table beside them, with\n",
      "the pieces set out but no game started. And then, for perhaps half a minute\n",
      "in all, something happened to the telescreens. The tune that they were\n",
      "playing changed, and the tone of the music changed too. There came into\n",
      "it--but it was something hard to describe. It was a peculiar, cracked,\n",
      "braying, jeering note: in his mind Winston called it a yellow note. And\n",
      "then a voice from the telescreen was singing:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Under the spreading chestnut tree\n",
      "  I sold you and you sold me:\n",
      "  There lie they, and here lie we\n",
      "  Under the spreading chestnut tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The three men never stirred. But when Winston glanced again at Rutherford's\n",
      "ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears. And for the first\n",
      "time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing\n",
      "AT WHAT he shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little later all three were re-arrested. It appeared that they had\n",
      "engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release. At\n",
      "their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with\n",
      "a whole string of new ones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded\n",
      "in the Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five years after\n",
      "this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just\n",
      "flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment\n",
      "of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then\n",
      "forgotten. The instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance.\n",
      "It was a half-page torn out of 'The Times' of about ten years earlier--the\n",
      "top half of the page, so that it included the date--and it contained a\n",
      "photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York. Prominent\n",
      "in the middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. There was\n",
      "no mistaking them, in any case their names were in the caption at the\n",
      "bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that\n",
      "date they had been on Eurasian soil. They had flown from a secret airfield\n",
      "in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with\n",
      "members of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important\n",
      "military secrets. The date had stuck in Winston's memory because it chanced\n",
      "to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless\n",
      "other places as well. There was only one possible conclusion: the\n",
      "confessions were lies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that time Winston\n",
      "had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had\n",
      "actually committed the crimes that they were accused of. But this was\n",
      "concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil\n",
      "bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory.\n",
      "It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some way it could have\n",
      "been published to the world and its significance made known.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what the photograph\n",
      "was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper.\n",
      "Luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of\n",
      "view of the telescreen.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as\n",
      "to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. To keep your face\n",
      "expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be\n",
      "controlled, with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your\n",
      "heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He let\n",
      "what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the\n",
      "fear that some accident--a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for\n",
      "instance--would betray him. Then, without uncovering it again, he dropped\n",
      "the photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste papers.\n",
      "Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was ten--eleven years ago. Today, probably, he would have kept that\n",
      "photograph. It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers\n",
      "seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself,\n",
      "as well as the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party's hold\n",
      "upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which\n",
      "existed no longer HAD ONCE existed?\n",
      "\n",
      "But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes,\n",
      "the photograph might not even be evidence. Already, at the time when he\n",
      "made his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must\n",
      "have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed\n",
      "their country. Since then there had been other changes--two, three,\n",
      "he could not remember how many. Very likely the confessions had been\n",
      "rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer\n",
      "had the smallest significance. The past not only changed, but changed\n",
      "continuously. What most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that\n",
      "he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken.\n",
      "The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the\n",
      "ultimate motive was mysterious. He took up his pen again and wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was\n",
      "a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. At one time it\n",
      "had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun;\n",
      "today, to believe that the past is unalterable. He might be ALONE in\n",
      "holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of being\n",
      "a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might also\n",
      "be wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "He picked up the children's history book and looked at the portrait of\n",
      "Big Brother which formed its frontispiece. The hypnotic eyes gazed into\n",
      "his own. It was as though some huge force were pressing down upon\n",
      "you--something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your\n",
      "brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to\n",
      "deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the Party would announce that\n",
      "two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable\n",
      "that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their\n",
      "position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very\n",
      "existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The\n",
      "heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that\n",
      "they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right.\n",
      "For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the\n",
      "force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past\n",
      "and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is\n",
      "controllable what then?\n",
      "\n",
      "But no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord. The face\n",
      "of O'Brien, not called up by any obvious association, had floated into his\n",
      "mind. He knew, with more certainty than before, that O'Brien was on his\n",
      "side. He was writing the diary for O'Brien--TO O'Brien: it was like an\n",
      "interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressed\n",
      "to a particular person and took its colour from that fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was\n",
      "their final, most essential command. His heart sank as he thought of\n",
      "the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any Party\n",
      "intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he\n",
      "would not be able to understand, much less answer. And yet he was in the\n",
      "right! They were wrong and he was right. The obvious, the silly, and the\n",

      "From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting\n",
      "coffee--real coffee, not Victory Coffee--came floating out into the street.\n",
      "Winston paused involuntarily. For perhaps two seconds he was back in the\n",
      "half-forgotten world of his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cut\n",
      "off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had walked several kilometres over pavements, and his varicose ulcer\n",
      "was throbbing. This was the second time in three weeks that he had missed\n",
      "an evening at the Community Centre: a rash act, since you could be certain\n",
      "that the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked.\n",
      "In principle a Party member had no spare time, and was never alone except\n",
      "in bed. It was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping\n",
      "he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation: to do anything\n",
      "that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself,\n",
      "was always slightly dangerous. There was a word for it in Newspeak:\n",
      "OWNLIFE, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. But this\n",
      "evening as he came out of the Ministry the balminess of the April air had\n",
      "tempted him. The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year, and\n",
      "suddenly the long, noisy evening at the Centre, the boring, exhausting\n",
      "games, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed\n",
      "intolerable. On impulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered\n",
      "off into the labyrinth of London, first south, then east, then north again,\n",
      "losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in which\n",
      "direction he was going.\n",
      "\n",
      "'If there is hope,' he had written in the diary, 'it lies in the proles.'\n",
      "The words kept coming back to him, statement of a mystical truth and a\n",
      "palpable absurdity. He was somewhere in the vague, brown-coloured slums\n",
      "to the north and east of what had once been Saint Pancras Station. He was\n",
      "walking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses with battered\n",
      "doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow\n",
      "curiously suggestive of ratholes. There were puddles of filthy water here\n",
      "and there among the cobbles. In and out of the dark doorways, and down\n",
      "narrow alley-ways that branched off on either side, people swarmed in\n",
      "astonishing numbers--girls in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths,\n",
      "and youths who chased the girls, and swollen waddling women who showed you\n",
      "what the girls would be like in ten years' time, and old bent creatures\n",
      "shuffling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who played\n",
      "in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers.\n",
      "Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up.\n",
      "Most of the people paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with a\n",
      "sort of guarded curiosity. Two monstrous women with brick-red forearms\n",
      "folded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway. Winston caught\n",
      "scraps of conversation as he approached.\n",
      "\n",
      "'\"Yes,\" I says to 'er, \"that's all very well,\" I says. \"But if you'd of\n",
      "been in my place you'd of done the same as what I done. It's easy to\n",
      "criticize,\" I says, \"but you ain't got the same problems as what I got.\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah,' said the other, 'that's jest it. That's jest where it is.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The strident voices stopped abruptly. The women studied him in hostile\n",
      "silence as he went past. But it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kind\n",
      "of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar\n",
      "animal. The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a\n",
      "street like this. Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless\n",
      "you had definite business there. The patrols might stop you if you happened\n",
      "to run into them. 'May I see your papers, comrade? What are you doing here?\n",
      "What time did you leave work? Is this your usual way home?'--and so on and\n",
      "so forth. Not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual\n",
      "route: but it was enough to draw attention to you if the Thought Police\n",
      "heard about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. There were yells of warning\n",
      "from all sides. People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits. A\n",
      "young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a\n",
      "tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back\n",
      "again, all in one movement. At the same instant a man in a concertina-like\n",
      "black suit, who had emerged from a side alley, ran towards Winston,\n",
      "pointing excitedly to the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Steamer!' he yelled. 'Look out, guv'nor! Bang over'ead! Lay down quick!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Steamer' was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to\n",
      "rocket bombs. Winston promptly flung himself on his face. The proles were\n",
      "nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind. They seemed\n",
      "to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance\n",
      "when a rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly travelled faster\n",
      "than sound. Winston clasped his forearms above his head. There was a roar\n",
      "that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects pattered\n",
      "on to his back. When he stood up he found that he was covered with\n",
      "fragments of glass from the nearest window.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 metres up the\n",
      "street. A black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of\n",
      "plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins. There\n",
      "was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in\n",
      "the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. When he got up to it he\n",
      "saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist. Apart from the bloody\n",
      "stump, the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.\n",
      "\n",
      "He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned\n",
      "down a side-street to the right. Within three or four minutes he was out\n",
      "of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of\n",
      "the streets was going on as though nothing had happened. It was nearly\n",
      "twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the proles frequented ('pubs',\n",
      "they called them) were choked with customers. From their grimy swing doors,\n",
      "endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust,\n",
      "and sour beer. In an angle formed by a projecting house-front three men\n",
      "were standing very close together, the middle one of them holding a\n",
      "folded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder.\n",
      "Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces,\n",
      "Winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies. It was\n",
      "obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading. He was a few\n",
      "paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men\n",
      "were in violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on the point\n",
      "of blows.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Can't you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell you no number ending\n",
      "in seven ain't won for over fourteen months!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, it 'as, then!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, it 'as not! Back 'ome I got the 'ole lot of 'em for over two years\n",
      "wrote down on a piece of paper. I takes 'em down reg'lar as the clock. An'\n",
      "I tell you, no number ending in seven----'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, a seven 'AS won! I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number.\n",
      "Four oh seven, it ended in. It were in February--second week in February.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'February your grandmother! I got it all down in black and white. An' I\n",
      "tell you, no number----'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, pack it in!' said the third man.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked back when he had gone\n",
      "thirty metres. They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces.\n",
      "The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public\n",
      "event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that\n",
      "there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal\n",
      "if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their\n",
      "folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was\n",
      "concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of\n",
      "intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole\n",
      "tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and\n",
      "lucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do with the running of the Lottery,\n",
      "which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed\n",
      "everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary.\n",
      "Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being\n",
      "non-existent persons. In the absence of any real intercommunication between\n",
      "one part of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling on to that.\n",
      "When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you looked at\n",
      "the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of\n",
      "faith. The street into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling\n",
      "that he had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was a main\n",
      "thoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead there came a din of\n",
      "shouting voices. The street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight\n",
      "of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stall-keepers\n",
      "were selling tired-looking vegetables. At this moment Winston remembered\n",
      "where he was. The alley led out into the main street, and down the next\n",
      "turning, not five minutes away, was the junk-shop where he had bought the\n",
      "blank book which was now his diary. And in a small stationer's shop not\n",
      "far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink.\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On the opposite side of\n",
      "the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted\n",
      "over but in reality were merely coated with dust. A very old man, bent but\n",
      "active, with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn,\n",
      "pushed open the swing door and went in. As Winston stood watching, it\n",
      "occurred to him that the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had\n",
      "already been middle-aged when the Revolution happened. He and a few others\n",
      "like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of\n",
      "capitalism. In the Party itself there were not many people left whose ideas\n",
      "had been formed before the Revolution. The older generation had mostly\n",
      "been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the few\n",
      "who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual\n",
      "surrender. If there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful\n",
      "account of conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be a\n",
      "prole. Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into\n",
      "his diary came back into Winston's mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold\n",
      "of him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with that\n",
      "old man and question him. He would say to him: 'Tell me about your life\n",
      "when you were a boy. What was it like in those days? Were things better\n",
      "than they are now, or were they worse?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, he descended the\n",
      "steps and crossed the narrow street. It was madness of course. As usual,\n",
      "there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their\n",
      "pubs, but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If the\n",
      "patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not\n",
      "likely that they would believe him. He pushed open the door, and a hideous\n",
      "cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face. As he entered the din of\n",
      "voices dropped to about half its volume. Behind his back he could feel\n",
      "everyone eyeing his blue overalls. A game of darts which was going on at\n",
      "the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty\n",
      "seconds. The old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar, having\n",
      "some kind of altercation with the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed young\n",
      "man with enormous forearms. A knot of others, standing round with glasses\n",
      "in their hands, were watching the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I arst you civil enough, didn't I?' said the old man, straightening his\n",
      "shoulders pugnaciously. 'You telling me you ain't got a pint mug in the\n",
      "'ole bleeding boozer?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And what in hell's name IS a pint?' said the barman, leaning forward with\n",
      "the tips of his fingers on the counter.\n",
      "\n",
      "''Ark at 'im! Calls 'isself a barman and don't know what a pint is! Why,\n",
      "a pint's the 'alf of a quart, and there's four quarts to the gallon.\n",
      "'Ave to teach you the A, B, C next.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Never heard of 'em,' said the barman shortly. 'Litre and half\n",
      "litre--that's all we serve. There's the glasses on the shelf in front\n",
      "of you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I likes a pint,' persisted the old man. 'You could 'a drawed me off a pint\n",
      "easy enough. We didn't 'ave these bleeding litres when I was a young man.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'When you were a young man we were all living in the treetops,' said the\n",
      "barman, with a glance at the other customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by Winston's entry\n",
      "seemed to disappear. The old man's white-stubbled face had flushed pink. He\n",
      "turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caught\n",
      "him gently by the arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "'May I offer you a drink?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You're a gent,' said the other, straightening his shoulders again. He\n",
      "appeared not to have noticed Winston's blue overalls. 'Pint!' he added\n",
      "aggressively to the barman. 'Pint of wallop.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer into thick glasses\n",
      "which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter. Beer was the only drink\n",
      "you could get in prole pubs. The proles were supposed not to drink gin,\n",
      "though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game of\n",
      "darts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun\n",
      "talking about lottery tickets. Winston's presence was forgotten for a\n",
      "moment. There was a deal table under the window where he and the old man\n",
      "could talk without fear of being overheard. It was horribly dangerous, but\n",
      "at any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had made sure\n",
      "of as soon as he came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "''E could 'a drawed me off a pint,' grumbled the old man as he settled down\n",
      "behind a glass. 'A 'alf litre ain't enough. It don't satisfy. And a 'ole\n",
      "litre's too much. It starts my bladder running. Let alone the price.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You must have seen great changes since you were a young man,' said\n",
      "Winston tentatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man's pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, and\n",
      "from the bar to the door of the Gents, as though it were in the bar-room\n",
      "that he expected the changes to have occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The beer was better,' he said finally. 'And cheaper! When I was a young\n",
      "man, mild beer--wallop we used to call it--was fourpence a pint. That was\n",
      "before the war, of course.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Which war was that?' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's all wars,' said the old man vaguely. He took up his glass, and his\n",
      "shoulders straightened again. ''Ere's wishing you the very best of 'ealth!'\n",
      "\n",
      "In his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam's apple made a surprisingly rapid\n",
      "up-and-down movement, and the beer vanished. Winston went to the bar and\n",
      "came back with two more half-litres. The old man appeared to have forgotten\n",
      "his prejudice against drinking a full litre.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are very much older than I am,' said Winston. 'You must have been a\n",
      "grown man before I was born. You can remember what it was like in the old\n",
      "days, before the Revolution. People of my age don't really know anything\n",
      "about those times. We can only read about them in books, and what it says\n",
      "in the books may not be true. I should like your opinion on that. The\n",
      "history books say that life before the Revolution was completely different\n",
      "from what it is now. There was the most terrible oppression, injustice,\n",
      "poverty worse than anything we can imagine. Here in London, the great mass\n",
      "of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. Half of them\n",
      "hadn't even boots on their feet. They worked twelve hours a day, they left\n",
      "school at nine, they slept ten in a room. And at the same time there were\n",
      "a very few people, only a few thousands--the capitalists, they were\n",
      "called--who were rich and powerful. They owned everything that there was\n",
      "to own. They lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, they\n",
      "rode about in motor-cars and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne,\n",
      "they wore top hats----'\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man brightened suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Top 'ats!' he said. 'Funny you should mention 'em. The same thing come\n",
      "into my 'ead only yesterday, I dono why. I was jest thinking, I ain't seen\n",
      "a top 'at in years. Gorn right out, they 'ave. The last time I wore one\n",
      "was at my sister-in-law's funeral. And that was--well, I couldn't give you\n",
      "the date, but it must'a been fifty years ago. Of course it was only 'ired\n",
      "for the occasion, you understand.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It isn't very important about the top hats,' said Winston patiently.\n",
      "'The point is, these capitalists--they and a few lawyers and priests and\n",
      "so forth who lived on them--were the lords of the earth. Everything existed\n",
      "for their benefit. You--the ordinary people, the workers--were their\n",
      "slaves. They could do what they liked with you. They could ship you off to\n",
      "Canada like cattle. They could sleep with your daughters if they chose.\n",
      "They could order you to be flogged with something called a cat-o'-nine\n",
      "tails. You had to take your cap off when you passed them. Every capitalist\n",
      "went about with a gang of lackeys who----'\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man brightened again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Lackeys!' he said. 'Now there's a word I ain't 'eard since ever so long.\n",
      "Lackeys! That reg'lar takes me back, that does. I recollect--oh, donkey's\n",
      "years ago--I used to sometimes go to 'Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to\n",
      "'ear the blokes making speeches. Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews,\n",
      "Indians--all sorts there was. And there was one bloke--well, I couldn't\n",
      "give you 'is name, but a real powerful speaker 'e was. 'E didn't 'alf\n",
      "give it 'em! \"Lackeys!\" 'e says, \"lackeys of the bourgeoisie! Flunkies of\n",
      "the ruling class!\" Parasites--that was another of them. And 'yenas--'e\n",
      "definitely called 'em 'yenas. Of course 'e was referring to the Labour\n",
      "Party, you understand.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston had the feeling that they were talking at cross-purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What I really wanted to know was this,' he said. 'Do you feel that you\n",
      "have more freedom now than you had in those days? Are you treated more\n",
      "like a human being? In the old days, the rich people, the people at the\n",
      "top----'\n",
      "\n",
      "'The 'Ouse of Lords,' put in the old man reminiscently.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The House of Lords, if you like. What I am asking is, were these people\n",
      "able to treat you as an inferior, simply because they were rich and you\n",
      "were poor? Is it a fact, for instance, that you had to call them \"Sir\" and\n",
      "take off your cap when you passed them?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man appeared to think deeply. He drank off about a quarter of his\n",
      "beer before answering.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' he said. 'They liked you to touch your cap to 'em. It showed\n",
      "respect, like. I didn't agree with it, myself, but I done it often enough.\n",
      "Had to, as you might say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And was it usual--I'm only quoting what I've read in history books--was\n",
      "it usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavement\n",
      "into the gutter?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'One of 'em pushed me once,' said the old man. 'I recollect it as if it\n",
      "was yesterday. It was Boat Race night--terribly rowdy they used to get on\n",
      "Boat Race night--and I bumps into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue.\n",
      "Quite a gent, 'e was--dress shirt, top 'at, black overcoat. 'E was kind\n",
      "of zig-zagging across the pavement, and I bumps into 'im accidental-like.\n",

      "A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The old man's memory was\n",
      "nothing but a rubbish-heap of details. One could question him all day\n",
      "without getting any real information. The party histories might still be\n",
      "true, after a fashion: they might even be completely true. He made a last\n",
      "attempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Perhaps I have not made myself clear,' he said. 'What I'm trying to say\n",
      "is this. You have been alive a very long time; you lived half your life\n",
      "before the Revolution. In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up.\n",
      "Would you say from what you can remember, that life in 1925 was better\n",
      "than it is now, or worse? If you could choose, would you prefer to live\n",
      "then or now?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man looked meditatively at the darts board. He finished up his\n",
      "beer, more slowly than before. When he spoke it was with a tolerant\n",
      "philosophical air, as though the beer had mellowed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I know what you expect me to say,' he said. 'You expect me to say as I'd\n",
      "sooner be young again. Most people'd say they'd sooner be young, if you\n",
      "arst 'em. You got your 'ealth and strength when you're young. When you\n",
      "get to my time of life you ain't never well. I suffer something wicked\n",
      "from my feet, and my bladder's jest terrible. Six and seven times a night\n",
      "it 'as me out of bed. On the other 'and, there's great advantages in being\n",
      "a old man. You ain't got the same worries. No truck with women, and that's\n",
      "a great thing. I ain't 'ad a woman for near on thirty year, if you'd\n",
      "credit it. Nor wanted to, what's more.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston sat back against the window-sill. It was no use going on. He was\n",
      "about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled\n",
      "rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. The extra\n",
      "half-litre was already working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two\n",
      "gazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out\n",
      "into the street again. Within twenty years at the most, he reflected, the\n",
      "huge and simple question, 'Was life better before the Revolution than it\n",
      "is now?' would have ceased once and for all to be answerable. But in effect\n",
      "it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the\n",
      "ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They\n",
      "remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for\n",
      "a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister's face, the\n",
      "swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevant\n",
      "facts were outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant,\n",
      "which can see small objects but not large ones. And when memory failed and\n",
      "written records were falsified--when that happened, the claim of the Party\n",
      "to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted,\n",
      "because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard\n",
      "against which it could be tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. He halted and looked\n",
      "up. He was in a narrow street, with a few dark little shops, interspersed\n",
      "among dwelling-houses. Immediately above his head there hung three\n",
      "discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. He\n",
      "seemed to know the place. Of course! He was standing outside the junk-shop\n",
      "where he had bought the diary.\n",
      "\n",
      "A twinge of fear went through him. It had been a sufficiently rash act to\n",
      "buy the book in the beginning, and he had sworn never to come near the\n",
      "place again. And yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander,\n",
      "his feet had brought him back here of their own accord. It was precisely\n",
      "against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself\n",
      "by opening the diary. At the same time he noticed that although it was\n",
      "nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open. With the feeling that he\n",
      "would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement, he\n",
      "stepped through the doorway. If questioned, he could plausibly say that\n",
      "he was trying to buy razor blades.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off an\n",
      "unclean but friendly smell. He was a man of perhaps sixty, frail and\n",
      "bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and mild eyes distorted by thick\n",
      "spectacles. His hair was almost white, but his eyebrows were bushy and\n",
      "still black. His spectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact\n",
      "that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague air\n",
      "of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of literary man, or\n",
      "perhaps a musician. His voice was soft, as though faded, and his accent\n",
      "less debased than that of the majority of proles.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I recognized you on the pavement,' he said immediately. 'You're the\n",
      "gentleman that bought the young lady's keepsake album. That was a beautiful\n",
      "bit of paper, that was. Cream-laid, it used to be called. There's been no\n",
      "paper like that made for--oh, I dare say fifty years.' He peered at Winston\n",
      "over the top of his spectacles. 'Is there anything special I can do for\n",
      "you? Or did you just want to look round?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I was passing,' said Winston vaguely. 'I just looked in. I don't want\n",
      "anything in particular.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's just as well,' said the other, 'because I don't suppose I could have\n",
      "satisfied you.' He made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand.\n",
      "'You see how it is; an empty shop, you might say. Between you and me, the\n",
      "antique trade's just about finished. No demand any longer, and no stock\n",
      "either. Furniture, china, glass it's all been broken up by degrees. And\n",
      "of course the metal stuff's mostly been melted down. I haven't seen a brass\n",
      "candlestick in years.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full, but there\n",
      "was almost nothing in it of the slightest value. The floorspace was very\n",
      "restricted, because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty\n",
      "picture-frames. In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out\n",
      "chisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not even\n",
      "pretend to be in going order, and other miscellaneous rubbish. Only on a\n",
      "small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends--lacquered\n",
      "snuffboxes, agate brooches, and the like--which looked as though they might\n",
      "include something interesting. As Winston wandered towards the table his\n",
      "eye was caught by a round, smooth thing that gleamed softly in the\n",
      "lamplight, and he picked it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, making\n",
      "almost a hemisphere. There was a peculiar softness, as of rainwater, in\n",
      "both the colour and the texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magnified\n",
      "by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that\n",
      "recalled a rose or a sea anemone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What is it?' said Winston, fascinated.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's coral, that is,' said the old man. 'It must have come from the\n",
      "Indian Ocean. They used to kind of embed it in the glass. That wasn't made\n",
      "less than a hundred years ago. More, by the look of it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a beautiful thing,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is a beautiful thing,' said the other appreciatively. 'But there's not\n",
      "many that'd say so nowadays.' He coughed. 'Now, if it so happened that you\n",
      "wanted to buy it, that'd cost you four dollars. I can remember when a thing\n",
      "like that would have fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was--well, I\n",
      "can't work it out, but it was a lot of money. But who cares about genuine\n",
      "antiques nowadays--even the few that's left?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing\n",
      "into his pocket. What appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty\n",
      "as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different\n",
      "from the present one. The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass\n",
      "that he had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because of its\n",
      "apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it must once have been\n",
      "intended as a paperweight. It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately\n",
      "it did not make much of a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromising\n",
      "thing, for a Party member to have in his possession. Anything old, and for\n",
      "that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. The old man had\n",
      "grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars. Winston\n",
      "realized that he would have accepted three or even two.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at,' he\n",
      "said. 'There's not much in it. Just a few pieces. We'll do with a light if\n",
      "we're going upstairs.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the\n",
      "steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did\n",
      "not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of\n",
      "chimney-pots. Winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as\n",
      "though the room were meant to be lived in. There was a strip of carpet on\n",
      "the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly arm-chair\n",
      "drawn up to the fireplace. An old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour\n",
      "face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupying\n",
      "nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress still\n",
      "on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We lived here till my wife died,' said the old man half apologetically.\n",
      "'I'm selling the furniture off by little and little. Now that's a beautiful\n",
      "mahogany bed, or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it.\n",
      "But I dare say you'd find it a little bit cumbersome.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He was holding the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, and\n",
      "in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. The thought\n",
      "flitted through Winston's mind that it would probably be quite easy to\n",
      "rent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It\n",
      "was a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but\n",
      "the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral\n",
      "memory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in\n",
      "a room like this, in an arm-chair beside an open fire with your feet in\n",
      "the fender and a kettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with\n",
      "nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing\n",
      "of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's no telescreen!' he could not help murmuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah,' said the old man, 'I never had one of those things. Too expensive.\n",
      "And I never seemed to feel the need of it, somehow. Now that's a nice\n",
      "gateleg table in the corner there. Though of course you'd have to put new\n",
      "hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a small bookcase in the other corner, and Winston had already\n",
      "gravitated towards it. It contained nothing but rubbish. The hunting-down\n",
      "and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the\n",
      "prole quarters as everywhere else. It was very unlikely that there existed\n",
      "anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960. The old\n",
      "man, still carrying the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in a\n",
      "rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite\n",
      "the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all----' he began\n",
      "delicately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a steel engraving of an\n",
      "oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front. There\n",
      "was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there was\n",
      "what appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for some moments. It\n",
      "seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The frame's fixed to the wall,' said the old man, 'but I could unscrew it\n",
      "for you, I dare say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I know that building,' said Winston finally. 'It's a ruin now. It's in\n",
      "the middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in--oh, many years\n",
      "ago. It was a church at one time, St Clement Danes, its name was.' He\n",
      "smiled apologetically, as though conscious of saying something slightly\n",
      "ridiculous, and added: 'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What's that?' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh--\"Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's.\" That was a rhyme\n",
      "we had when I was a little boy. How it goes on I don't remember, but I do\n",
      "know it ended up, \"Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here comes a\n",
      "chopper to chop off your head.\" It was a kind of a dance. They held out\n",
      "their arms for you to pass under, and when they came to \"Here comes a\n",
      "chopper to chop off your head\" they brought their arms down and caught you.\n",
      "It was just names of churches. All the London churches were in it--all the\n",
      "principal ones, that is.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged. It was always\n",
      "difficult to determine the age of a London building. Anything large and\n",
      "impressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was automatically\n",
      "claimed as having been built since the Revolution, while anything that was\n",
      "obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle\n",
      "Ages. The centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any\n",
      "value. One could not learn history from architecture any more than one\n",
      "could learn it from books. Statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the\n",
      "names of streets--anything that might throw light upon the past had been\n",
      "systematically altered.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never knew it had been a church,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's a lot of them left, really,' said the old man, 'though they've\n",
      "been put to other uses. Now, how did that rhyme go? Ah! I've got it!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,\n",
      "  You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "there, now, that's as far as I can get. A farthing, that was a small copper\n",
      "coin, looked something like a cent.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Where was St Martin's?' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'St Martin's? That's still standing. It's in Victory Square, alongside the\n",
      "picture gallery. A building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars\n",
      "in front, and a big flight of steps.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston knew the place well. It was a museum used for propaganda displays\n",
      "of various kinds--scale models of rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses,\n",
      "waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities, and the like.\n",
      "\n",
      "'St Martin's-in-the-Fields it used to be called,' supplemented the old man,\n",
      "'though I don't recollect any fields anywhere in those parts.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston did not buy the picture. It would have been an even more\n",
      "incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry\n",
      "home, unless it were taken out of its frame. But he lingered for some\n",
      "minutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not\n",
      "Weeks--as one might have gathered from the inscription over the\n",
      "shop-front--but Charrington. Mr Charrington, it seemed, was a widower aged\n",
      "sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years. Throughout that\n",
      "time he had been intending to alter the name over the window, but had never\n",
      "quite got to the point of doing it. All the while that they were talking\n",
      "the half-remembered rhyme kept running through Winston's head. Oranges and\n",
      "lemons say the bells of St Clement's, You owe me three farthings, say\n",
      "the bells of St Martin's! It was curious, but when you said it to yourself\n",
      "you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost London\n",
      "that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. From one\n",
      "ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. Yet so\n",
      "far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells\n",
      "ringing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He got away from Mr Charrington and went down the stairs alone, so as not\n",
      "to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of\n",
      "the door. He had already made up his mind that after a suitable\n",
      "interval--a month, say--he would take the risk of visiting the shop again.\n",
      "It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre.\n",
      "The serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place,\n",
      "after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the\n",
      "shop could be trusted. However----!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he thought again, he would come back. He would buy further scraps of\n",
      "beautiful rubbish. He would buy the engraving of St Clement Danes, take\n",
      "it out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his\n",
      "overalls. He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington's\n",
      "memory. Even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed\n",
      "momentarily through his mind again. For perhaps five seconds exaltation\n",
      "made him careless, and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much\n",
      "as a preliminary glance through the window. He had even started humming\n",
      "to an improvised tune\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,\n",
      "  You owe me three farthings, say the----\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water. A figure\n",
      "in blue overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten metres away. It was\n",
      "the girl from the Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The light\n",
      "was failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. She looked\n",
      "him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had not\n",
      "seen him.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move. Then he turned to the\n",
      "right and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment that he was\n",
      "going in the wrong direction. At any rate, one question was settled. There\n",
      "was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. She must have\n",
      "followed him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance she\n",
      "should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure\n",
      "backstreet, kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived.\n",
      "It was too great a coincidence. Whether she was really an agent of the\n",
      "Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness, hardly\n",
      "mattered. It was enough that she was watching him. Probably she had seen\n",
      "him go into the pub as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in his pocket banged against\n",
      "his thigh at each step, and he was half minded to take it out and throw it\n",
      "away. The worst thing was the pain in his belly. For a couple of minutes\n",
      "he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon.\n",
      "But there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. Then the\n",
      "spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The street was a blind alley. Winston halted, stood for several seconds\n",
      "wondering vaguely what to do, then turned round and began to retrace his\n",
      "steps. As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him\n",
      "three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her.\n",
      "He could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then\n",
      "smash her skull in with a cobblestone. The piece of glass in his pocket\n",
      "would be heavy enough for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately,\n",
      "because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable. He\n",
      "could not run, he could not strike a blow. Besides, she was young and lusty\n",
      "and would defend herself. He thought also of hurrying to the Community\n",
      "Centre and staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a\n",
      "partial alibi for the evening. But that too was impossible. A deadly\n",
      "lassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get home quickly and\n",
      "then sit down and be quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat. The lights\n",
      "would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty. He went into the\n",
      "kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went to\n",
      "the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer.\n",
      "But he did not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy female voice\n",
      "was squalling a patriotic song. He sat staring at the marbled cover of the\n",

      "It was at night that they came for you, always at night. The proper thing\n",
      "was to kill yourself before they got you. Undoubtedly some people did so.\n",
      "Many of the disappearances were actually suicides. But it needed desperate\n",
      "courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick and\n",
      "certain poison, were completely unprocurable. He thought with a kind of\n",
      "astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery\n",
      "of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment\n",
      "when a special effort is needed. He might have silenced the dark-haired\n",
      "girl if only he had acted quickly enough: but precisely because of the\n",
      "extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act. It struck him that\n",
      "in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but\n",
      "always against one's own body. Even now, in spite of the gin, the dull\n",
      "ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible. And it is the same,\n",
      "he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations. On the\n",
      "battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that\n",
      "you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up until\n",
      "it fills the universe, and even when you are not paralysed by fright or\n",
      "screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or\n",
      "cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened the diary. It was important to write something down. The woman\n",
      "on the telescreen had started a new song. Her voice seemed to stick into\n",
      "his brain like jagged splinters of glass. He tried to think of O'Brien,\n",
      "for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking\n",
      "of the things that would happen to him after the Thought Police took him\n",
      "away. It would not matter if they killed you at once. To be killed was\n",
      "what you expected. But before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet\n",
      "everybody knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had to\n",
      "be gone through: the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy, the\n",
      "crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth and bloody clots of hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same? Why was\n",
      "it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life? Nobody ever\n",
      "escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess. When once you had\n",
      "succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be\n",
      "dead. Why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded\n",
      "in future time?\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of\n",
      "O'Brien. 'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' O'Brien\n",
      "had said to him. He knew what it meant, or thought he knew. The place where\n",
      "there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see,\n",
      "but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. But with the\n",
      "voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train\n",
      "of thought further. He put a cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobacco\n",
      "promptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to\n",
      "spit out again. The face of Big Brother swam into his mind, displacing that\n",
      "of O'Brien. Just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of\n",
      "his pocket and looked at it. The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm,\n",

      "\n",
      "A solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long,\n",
      "brightly-lit corridor. It was the girl with dark hair. Four days had gone\n",
      "past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk-shop.\n",
      "As she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable\n",
      "at a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls. Probably\n",
      "she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes\n",
      "on which the plots of novels were 'roughed in'. It was a common accident\n",
      "in the Fiction Department.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost\n",
      "flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her. She must have\n",
      "fallen right on the injured arm. Winston stopped short. The girl had risen\n",
      "to her knees. Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her\n",
      "mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed on his, with an\n",
      "appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart. In front of him was an enemy\n",
      "who was trying to kill him: in front of him, also, was a human creature,\n",
      "in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. Already he had instinctively\n",
      "started forward to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on\n",
      "the bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You're hurt?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's nothing. My arm. It'll be all right in a second.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She spoke as though her heart were fluttering. She had certainly turned\n",
      "very pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You haven't broken anything?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, I'm all right. It hurt for a moment, that's all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up. She had regained\n",
      "some of her colour, and appeared very much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's nothing,' she repeated shortly. 'I only gave my wrist a bit of a\n",

      "\n",
      "And with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going,\n",
      "as briskly as though it had really been nothing. The whole incident could\n",
      "not have taken as much as half a minute. Not to let one's feelings appear\n",
      "in one's face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct,\n",
      "and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen\n",
      "when the thing happened. Nevertheless it had been very difficult not to\n",
      "betray a momentary surprise, for in the two or three seconds while he was\n",
      "helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand. There was no\n",
      "question that she had done it intentionally. It was something small and\n",
      "flat. As he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his\n",
      "pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers. It was a scrap of paper\n",
      "folded into a square.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little more fingering, to\n",
      "get it unfolded. Obviously there must be a message of some kind written on\n",
      "it. For a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water-closets\n",
      "and read it at once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew.\n",
      "There was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens\n",
      "were watched continuously.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment of paper\n",
      "casually among the other papers on the desk, put on his spectacles and\n",
      "hitched the speakwrite towards him. 'Five minutes,' he told himself,\n",
      "'five minutes at the very least!' His heart bumped in his breast with\n",
      "frightening loudness. Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was\n",
      "mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, not needing\n",
      "close attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some kind of political\n",
      "meaning. So far as he could see there were two possibilities. One, much\n",
      "the more likely, was that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police,\n",
      "just as he had feared. He did not know why the Thought Police should\n",
      "choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they had\n",
      "their reasons. The thing that was written on the paper might be a threat, a\n",
      "summons, an order to commit suicide, a trap of some description. But there\n",
      "was another, wilder possibility that kept raising its head, though he\n",
      "tried vainly to suppress it. This was, that the message did not come from\n",
      "the Thought Police at all, but from some kind of underground organization.\n",
      "Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all! Perhaps the girl was part of it!\n",
      "No doubt the idea was absurd, but it had sprung into his mind in the very\n",
      "instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. It was not till a couple\n",
      "of minutes later that the other, more probable explanation had occurred to\n",
      "him. And even now, though his intellect told him that the message probably\n",
      "meant death--still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonable\n",
      "hope persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with difficulty that he\n",
      "kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the\n",
      "speakwrite.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic\n",
      "tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He re-adjusted his spectacles on his nose,\n",
      "sighed, and drew the next batch of work towards him, with the scrap of\n",
      "paper on top of it. He flattened it out. On it was written, in a large\n",
      "unformed handwriting:\n",
      "\n",
      "I LOVE YOU.\n",
      "\n",
      "For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating\n",
      "thing into the memory hole. When he did so, although he knew very well the\n",
      "danger of showing too much interest, he could not resist reading it once\n",
      "again, just to make sure that the words were really there.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work. What was even\n",
      "worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the\n",
      "need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen. He felt as though a\n",
      "fire were burning in his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled\n",
      "canteen was torment. He had hoped to be alone for a little while during\n",
      "the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile Parsons flopped\n",
      "down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of\n",
      "stew, and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week.\n",
      "He was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of Big\n",
      "Brother's head, two metres wide, which was being made for the occasion by\n",
      "his daughter's troop of Spies. The irritating thing was that in the racket\n",
      "of voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was saying, and was\n",
      "constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Just once\n",
      "he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls at the\n",
      "far end of the room. She appeared not to have seen him, and he did not\n",
      "look in that direction again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The afternoon was more bearable. Immediately after lunch there arrived a\n",
      "delicate, difficult piece of work which would take several hours and\n",
      "necessitated putting everything else aside. It consisted in falsifying a\n",
      "series of production reports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast\n",
      "discredit on a prominent member of the Inner Party, who was now under a\n",
      "cloud. This was the kind of thing that Winston was good at, and for more\n",
      "than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind\n",
      "altogether. Then the memory of her face came back, and with it a raging,\n",
      "intolerable desire to be alone. Until he could be alone it was impossible\n",
      "to think this new development out. Tonight was one of his nights at the\n",
      "Community Centre. He wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen, hurried\n",
      "off to the Centre, took part in the solemn foolery of a 'discussion group',\n",
      "played two games of table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, and\n",
      "sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled 'Ingsoc in relation to\n",
      "chess'. His soul writhed with boredom, but for once he had had no impulse\n",
      "to shirk his evening at the Centre. At the sight of the words I LOVE YOU\n",
      "the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor\n",
      "risks suddenly seemed stupid. It was not till twenty-three hours, when he\n",
      "was home and in bed--in the darkness, where you were safe even from the\n",
      "telescreen so long as you kept silent--that he was able to think\n",
      "continuously.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch with\n",
      "the girl and arrange a meeting. He did not consider any longer the\n",
      "possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him. He knew\n",
      "that it was not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed\n",
      "him the note. Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as well\n",
      "she might be. Nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his\n",
      "mind. Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with\n",
      "a cobblestone, but that was of no importance. He thought of her naked,\n",
      "youthful body, as he had seen it in his dream. He had imagined her a fool\n",
      "like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and hatred, her\n",
      "belly full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might\n",
      "lose her, the white youthful body might slip away from him! What he feared\n",
      "more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he\n",
      "did not get in touch with her quickly. But the physical difficulty of\n",
      "meeting was enormous. It was like trying to make a move at chess when you\n",
      "were already mated. Whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you.\n",
      "Actually, all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to\n",
      "him within five minutes of reading the note; but now, with time to think,\n",
      "he went over them one by one, as though laying out a row of instruments\n",
      "on a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not\n",
      "be repeated. If she had worked in the Records Department it might have\n",
      "been comparatively simple, but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in\n",
      "the building the Fiction Department lay, and he had no pretext for going\n",
      "there. If he had known where she lived, and at what time she left work,\n",
      "he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home; but to try\n",
      "to follow her home was not safe, because it would mean loitering about\n",
      "outside the Ministry, which was bound to be noticed. As for sending a\n",
      "letter through the mails, it was out of the question. By a routine that\n",
      "was not even secret, all letters were opened in transit. Actually, few\n",
      "people ever wrote letters. For the messages that it was occasionally\n",
      "necessary to send, there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases,\n",
      "and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any case he did not\n",
      "know the girl's name, let alone her address. Finally he decided that the\n",
      "safest place was the canteen. If he could get her at a table by herself,\n",
      "somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, and\n",
      "with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round--if these conditions\n",
      "endured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a few\n",
      "words.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a week after this, life was like a restless dream. On the next day she\n",
      "did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it, the whistle having\n",
      "already blown. Presumably she had been changed on to a later shift. They\n",
      "passed each other without a glance. On the day after that she was in the\n",
      "canteen at the usual time, but with three other girls and immediately\n",
      "under a telescreen. Then for three dreadful days she did not appear at\n",
      "all. His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable\n",
      "sensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made every movement, every\n",
      "sound, every contact, every word that he had to speak or listen to, an\n",
      "agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image. He did\n",
      "not touch the diary during those days. If there was any relief, it was in\n",
      "his work, in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a\n",
      "stretch. He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her. There\n",
      "was no enquiry he could make. She might have been vaporized, she might\n",
      "have committed suicide, she might have been transferred to the other end\n",
      "of Oceania: worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her\n",
      "mind and decided to avoid him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the sling and she had a\n",
      "band of sticking-plaster round her wrist. The relief of seeing her was\n",
      "so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several\n",
      "seconds. On the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her.\n",
      "When he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the\n",
      "wall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place was not very full.\n",
      "The queue edged forward till Winston was almost at the counter, then was\n",
      "held up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that he\n",
      "had not received his tablet of saccharine. But the girl was still alone\n",
      "when Winston secured his tray and began to make for her table. He walked\n",
      "casually towards her, his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond\n",
      "her. She was perhaps three metres away from him. Another two seconds would\n",
      "do it. Then a voice behind him called, 'Smith!' He pretended not to hear.\n",
      "'Smith!' repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no use. He turned round.\n",
      "A blond-headed, silly-faced young man named Wilsher, whom he barely knew,\n",
      "was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table. It was not\n",
      "safe to refuse. After having been recognized, he could not go and sit at\n",
      "a table with an unattended girl. It was too noticeable. He sat down with\n",
      "a friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his. Winston had a\n",
      "hallucination of himself smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it.\n",
      "The girl's table filled up a few minutes later.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she must have seen him coming towards her, and perhaps she would take\n",
      "the hint. Next day he took care to arrive early. Surely enough, she was at\n",
      "a table in about the same place, and again alone. The person immediately\n",
      "ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like man\n",
      "with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston turned away from\n",
      "the counter with his tray, he saw that the little man was making straight\n",
      "for the girl's table. His hopes sank again. There was a vacant place at a\n",
      "table further away, but something in the little man's appearance suggested\n",
      "that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the\n",
      "emptiest table. With ice at his heart Winston followed. It was no use\n",
      "unless he could get the girl alone. At this moment there was a tremendous\n",
      "crash. The little man was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying,\n",
      "two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor. He started\n",
      "to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston, whom he evidently\n",
      "suspected of having tripped him up. But it was all right. Five seconds\n",
      "later, with a thundering heart, Winston was sitting at the girl's table.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating.\n",
      "It was all-important to speak at once, before anyone else came, but now\n",
      "a terrible fear had taken possession of him. A week had gone by since\n",
      "she had first approached him. She would have changed her mind, she must\n",
      "have changed her mind! It was impossible that this affair should end\n",
      "successfully; such things did not happen in real life. He might have\n",
      "flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen\n",
      "Ampleforth, the hairy-eared poet, wandering limply round the room with\n",
      "a tray, looking for a place to sit down. In his vague way Ampleforth\n",
      "was attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down at his table if\n",
      "he caught sight of him. There was perhaps a minute in which to act. Both\n",
      "Winston and the girl were eating steadily. The stuff they were eating was\n",
      "a thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans. In a low murmur Winston\n",
      "began speaking. Neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned the\n",
      "watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls exchanged the few\n",
      "necessary words in low expressionless voices.\n",

      "Then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument, reading or\n",
      "pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column. It was not\n",
      "safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated. There were\n",

      "shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left. Suddenly\n",
      "everyone seemed to be running across the square. The girl nipped nimbly\n",
      "round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush.\n",

      "into the heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm's length of the girl,\n",
      "but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous\n",
      "woman, presumably his wife, who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of\n",
      "flesh. Winston wriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge managed\n",
      "to drive his shoulder between them. For a moment it felt as though his\n",
      "entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips, then he\n",

      "guns standing upright in each corner, was passing slowly down the street.\n",
      "In the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting,\n",
      "jammed close together. Their sad, Mongolian faces gazed out over the sides\n",
      "of the trucks utterly incurious. Occasionally when a truck jolted there\n",
      "was a clank-clank of metal: all the prisoners were wearing leg-irons.\n",
      "Truck-load after truck-load of the sad faces passed. Winston knew they\n",
      "were there but he saw them only intermittently. The girl's shoulder, and\n",
      "her arm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his. Her cheek was\n",
      "almost near enough for him to feel its warmth. She had immediately taken\n",
      "charge of the situation, just as she had done in the canteen. She began\n",
      "speaking in the same expressionless voice as before, with lips barely\n",

      "missing; a path across a field; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes;\n",

      "had soon stopped. The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity. Foreigners,\n",

      "one know what became of them, apart from the few who were hanged as\n",
      "war-criminals: the others simply vanished, presumably into forced-labour\n",

      "type, dirty, bearded and exhausted. From over scrubby cheekbones eyes\n",
      "looked into Winston's, sometimes with strange intensity, and flashed away\n",
      "again. The convoy was drawing to an end. In the last truck he could see an\n",
      "aged man, his face a mass of grizzled hair, standing upright with wrists\n",

      "It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a long time that\n",

      "sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head and look at her would have\n",
      "been inconceivable folly. With hands locked together, invisible among\n",
      "the press of bodies, they stared steadily in front of them, and instead\n",

      "sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations, who\n",

      "questions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on the walk from the\n",
      "station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not\n",
      "being followed. The train was full of proles, in holiday mood because of\n",
      "the summery weather. The wooden-seated carriage in which he travelled was\n",
      "filled to overflowing by a single enormous family, ranging from a toothless\n",
      "great-grandmother to a month-old baby, going out to spend an afternoon\n",
      "with 'in-laws' in the country, and, as they freely explained to Winston,\n",

      "\n",
      "The lane widened, and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him\n",
      "of, a mere cattle-track which plunged between the bushes. He had no watch,\n",
      "but it could not be fifteen yet. The bluebells were so thick underfoot\n",
      "that it was impossible not to tread on them. He knelt down and began\n",
      "picking some partly to pass the time away, but also from a vague idea that\n",
      "he would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when they\n",
      "met. He had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly\n",
      "scent when a sound at his back froze him, the unmistakable crackle of a\n",
      "foot on twigs. He went on picking bluebells. It was the best thing to do.\n",
      "It might be the girl, or he might have been followed after all. To look\n",
      "round was to show guilt. He picked another and another. A hand fell\n",
      "lightly on his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head, evidently as a warning\n",
      "that he must keep silent, then parted the bushes and quickly led the way\n",
      "along the narrow track into the wood. Obviously she had been that way\n",
      "before, for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston followed,\n",
      "still clasping his bunch of flowers. His first feeling was relief, but as\n",
      "he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him, with the scarlet\n",
      "sash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips, the\n",
      "sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him. Even now it seemed quite\n",
      "likely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw back\n",
      "after all. The sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves daunted\n",
      "him. Already on the walk from the station the May sunshine had made him\n",
      "feel dirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors, with the sooty dust of\n",
      "London in the pores of his skin. It occurred to him that till now she had\n",
      "probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open. They came to the\n",
      "fallen tree that she had spoken of. The girl hopped over and forced apart\n",
      "the bushes, in which there did not seem to be an opening. When Winston\n",
      "followed her, he found that they were in a natural clearing, a tiny grassy\n",

      "always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice. We're all\n",

      "\n",
      "'Would you believe,' he said, 'that till this moment I didn't know what\n",
      "colour your eyes were?' They were brown, he noted, a rather light shade of\n",

      "At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity. The youthful\n",
      "body was strained against his own, the mass of dark hair was against his\n",
      "face, and yes! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the\n",
      "wide red mouth. She had clasped her arms about his neck, she was calling\n",
      "him darling, precious one, loved one. He had pulled her down on to the\n",
      "ground, she was utterly unresisting, he could do what he liked with her.\n",
      "But the truth was that he had no physical sensation, except that of mere\n",
      "contact. All he felt was incredulity and pride. He was glad that this was\n",
      "happening, but he had no physical desire. It was too soon, her youth and\n",
      "prettiness had frightened him, he was too much used to living without\n",
      "women--he did not know the reason. The girl picked herself up and pulled a\n",

      "like the smoke of a rubbish fire. But at some time or another he had tasted\n",
      "chocolate like the piece she had given him. The first whiff of its scent\n",
      "had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down, but which was\n",
      "powerful and troubling.\n",
      "\n",

      "his consciousness, something strongly felt but not reducible to definite\n",
      "shape, like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye. He pushed it\n",
      "away from him, aware only that it was the memory of some action which he\n",

      "the Party, and especially the Inner Party, without using the kind of words\n",
      "that you saw chalked up in dripping alley-ways. He did not dislike it. It\n",

      "through the chequered shade, with their arms round each other's waists\n",
      "whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast. He noticed how much\n",
      "softer her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone. They did not\n",

      "recognition. He knew it by sight. An old, close-bitten pasture, with a\n",
      "footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged\n",
      "hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just\n",
      "perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves stirred faintly in dense\n",
      "masses like women's hair. Surely somewhere nearby, but out of sight,\n",
      "there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming?\n",
      "\n",
      "'Isn't there a stream somewhere near here?' he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's right, there is a stream. It's at the edge of the next field,\n",
      "actually. There are fish in it, great big ones. You can watch them lying\n",
      "in the pools under the willow trees, waving their tails.'\n",
      "\n",

      "again, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance\n",
      "to the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the\n",
      "afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and Julia clung\n",

      "of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate,\n",
      "no rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood\n",
      "and pour its music into nothingness? He wondered whether after all there\n",
      "was a microphone hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had spoken only in\n",
      "low whispers, and it would not pick up what they had said, but it would\n",
      "pick up the thrush. Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small,\n",
      "beetle-like man was listening intently--listening to that. But by degrees\n",
      "the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It was as\n",
      "though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got\n",
      "mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves. He stopped\n",
      "thinking and merely felt. The girl's waist in the bend of his arm was soft\n",
      "and warm. He pulled her round so that they were breast to breast; her body\n",
      "seemed to melt into his. Wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding as\n",
      "water. Their mouths clung together; it was quite different from the hard\n",
      "kisses they had exchanged earlier. When they moved their faces apart again\n",

      "and faced him. They were both breathing fast, but the smile had reappeared\n",
      "round the corners of her mouth. She stood looking at him for an instant,\n",
      "then felt at the zipper of her overalls. And, yes! it was almost as in his\n",
      "dream. Almost as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had torn her clothes\n",
      "off, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent\n",
      "gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated. Her body\n",
      "gleamed white in the sun. But for a moment he did not look at her body;\n",
      "his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint, bold smile.\n",

      "hundreds--thousands. Anything that hinted at corruption always filled him\n",
      "with a wild hope. Who knew, perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface,\n",
      "its cult of strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing\n",
      "iniquity. If he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or\n",
      "syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Anything to rot, to weaken, to\n",

      "upon the grass, among the fallen bluebells. This time there was no\n",
      "difficulty. Presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to\n",
      "normal speed, and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart. The\n",

      "where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. It was a good\n",
      "hiding-place when once you got there, but the getting there was very\n",
      "dangerous. For the rest they could meet only in the streets, in a different\n",
      "place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time. In the\n",
      "street it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. As they drifted\n",
      "down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking at one\n",

      "on and off like the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence\n",
      "by the approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, then\n",
      "taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly\n",
      "cut short as they parted at the agreed spot, then continued almost without\n",
      "introduction on the following day. Julia appeared to be quite used to this\n",
      "kind of conversation, which she called 'talking by instalments'. She was\n",
      "also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. Just once in\n",

      "hand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia's face a few centimetres from his\n",
      "own, deathly white, as white as chalk. Even her lips were white. She was\n",
      "dead! He clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live\n",

      "less dangerous, it would still have been difficult to find time to meet.\n",
      "Winston's working week was sixty hours, Julia's was even longer, and\n",
      "their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not\n",
      "often coincide. Julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free.\n",
      "She spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and\n",
      "demonstrations, distributing literature for the junior Anti-Sex League,\n",

      "If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones. She even induced\n",
      "Winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for\n",
      "the part-time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous Party\n",

      "chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor.\n",
      "She was 'not clever', but was fond of using her hands and felt at home\n",
      "with machinery. She could describe the whole process of composing a novel,\n",
      "from the general directive issued by the Planning Committee down to the\n",

      "pornography for distribution among the proles. It was nicknamed Muck House\n",

      "seemed to think it just as natural that 'they' should want to rob you of\n",
      "your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught. She hated\n",
      "the Party, and said so in the crudest words, but she made no general\n",
      "criticism of it. Except where it touched upon her own life she had no\n",
      "interest in Party doctrine. He noticed that she never used Newspeak words\n",
      "except the ones that had passed into everyday use. She had never heard of\n",

      "organized revolt against the Party, which was bound to be a failure,\n",
      "struck her as stupid. The clever thing was to break the rules and stay\n",
      "alive all the same. He wondered vaguely how many others like her there\n",
      "might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of\n",

      "meaning of the Party's sexual puritanism. It was not merely that the sex\n",
      "instinct created a world of its own which was outside the Party's control\n",
      "and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. What was more\n",
      "important was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable\n",
      "because it could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. The way\n",
      "she put it was:\n",

      "'When you make love you're using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy\n",
      "and don't give a damn for anything. They can't bear you to feel like that.\n",
      "They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. All this marching\n",
      "up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. If\n",

      "their bloody rot?'\n",
      "\n",
      "That was very true, he thought. There was a direct intimate connexion\n",
      "between chastity and political orthodoxy. For how could the fear, the\n",
      "hatred, and the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members be\n",
      "kept at the right pitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct\n",
      "and using it as a driving force? The sex impulse was dangerous to the\n",
      "Party, and the Party had turned it to account. They had played a similar\n",
      "trick with the instinct of parenthood. The family could not actually be\n",
      "abolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged to be fond of their\n",
      "children, in almost the old-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand,\n",
      "were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them\n",
      "and report their deviations. The family had become in effect an extension\n",
      "of the Thought Police. It was a device by means of which everyone could be\n",
      "surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately.\n",

      "her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon, which\n",

      "\n",
      "It was three or four months after they were married. They had lost their\n",
      "way on a community hike somewhere in Kent. They had only lagged behind\n",
      "the others for a couple of minutes, but they took a wrong turning, and\n",
      "presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk\n",
      "quarry. It was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres, with boulders at the\n",
      "bottom. There was nobody of whom they could ask the way. As soon as she\n",
      "realized that they were lost Katharine became very uneasy. To be away\n",
      "from the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling of\n",
      "wrong-doing. She wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and start\n",
      "searching in the other direction. But at this moment Winston noticed some\n",

      "One tuft was of two colours, magenta and brick-red, apparently growing on\n",

      "of the half-darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and two cups,\n",
      "provided by Mr Charrington. Winston lit the burner and set a pan of water\n",

      "the form of a vision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface\n",
      "of the gateleg table. As he had foreseen, Mr Charrington had made no\n",
      "difficulty about letting the room. He was obviously glad of the few dollars\n",
      "that it would bring him. Nor did he seem shocked or become offensively\n",
      "knowing when it was made clear that Winston wanted the room for the purpose\n",

      "generalities, with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he\n",
      "had become partly invisible. Privacy, he said, was a very valuable thing.\n",

      "the Music Department. The words of these songs were composed without any\n",
      "human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator.\n",
      "But the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an\n",
      "almost pleasant sound. He could hear the woman singing and the scrape of\n",
      "her shoes on the flagstones, and the cries of the children in the street,\n",
      "and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet the\n",

      "the temptation of having a hiding-place that was truly their own, indoors\n",
      "and near at hand, had been too much for both of them. For some time\n",
      "after their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange\n",
      "meetings. Working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of\n",
      "Hate Week. It was more than a month distant, but the enormous, complex\n",
      "preparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody.\n",
      "Finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day.\n",
      "They had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood. On the evening\n",
      "beforehand they met briefly in the street. As usual, Winston hardly looked\n",

      "For a moment he was violently angry. During the month that he had known\n",
      "her the nature of his desire for her had changed. At the beginning there\n",
      "had been little true sensuality in it. Their first love-making had been\n",
      "simply an act of the will. But after the second time it was different. The\n",
      "smell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemed\n",
      "to have got inside him, or into the air all round him. She had become a\n",
      "physical necessity, something that he not only wanted but felt that he\n",
      "had a right to. When she said that she could not come, he had the feeling\n",
      "that she was cheating him. But just at this moment the crowd pressed\n",
      "them together and their hands accidentally met. She gave the tips of his\n",
      "fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection. It\n",
      "struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment\n",
      "must be a normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as he had\n",
      "not felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. He wished that they\n",
      "were a married couple of ten years' standing. He wished that he were\n",
      "walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly\n",
      "and without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the\n",
      "household. He wished above all that they had some place where they could\n",
      "be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time\n",
      "they met. It was not actually at that moment, but at some time on the\n",
      "following day, that the idea of renting Mr Charrington's room had occurred\n",
      "to him. When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed with unexpected\n",
      "readiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It was as though they were\n",
      "intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the\n",
      "edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love.\n",
      "It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one's\n",
      "consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as\n",
      "surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one could perhaps\n",
      "postpone it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, wilful\n",
      "act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Julia burst into the\n",
      "room. She was carrying a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas, such as he had\n",
      "sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the Ministry. He started forward\n",
      "to take her in his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly,\n",
      "partly because she was still holding the tool-bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Half a second,' she said. 'Just let me show you what I've brought. Did\n",
      "you bring some of that filthy Victory Coffee? I thought you would. You\n",
      "can chuck it away again, because we shan't be needing it. Look here.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled out some spanners\n",
      "and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it. Underneath were a number\n",
      "of neat paper packets. The first packet that she passed to Winston had a\n",
      "strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling. It was filled with some kind of\n",
      "heavy, sand-like stuff which yielded wherever you touched it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It isn't sugar?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Real sugar. Not saccharine, sugar. And here's a loaf of bread--proper\n",
      "white bread, not our bloody stuff--and a little pot of jam. And here's a\n",
      "tin of milk--but look! This is the one I'm really proud of. I had to wrap\n",
      "a bit of sacking round it, because----'\n",
      "\n",
      "But she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up. The smell was\n",
      "already filling the room, a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation\n",
      "from his early childhood, but which one did occasionally meet with even\n",
      "now, blowing down a passage-way before a door slammed, or diffusing itself\n",
      "mysteriously in a crowded street, sniffed for an instant and then lost\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's coffee,' he murmured, 'real coffee.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's Inner Party coffee. There's a whole kilo here,' she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How did you manage to get hold of all these things?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's all Inner Party stuff. There's nothing those swine don't have,\n",

      "and--look, I got a little packet of tea as well.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'There's been a lot of tea about lately. They've captured India, or\n",
      "something,' she said vaguely. 'But listen, dear. I want you to turn your\n",
      "back on me for three minutes. Go and sit on the other side of the bed.\n",
      "Don't go too near the window. And don't turn round till I tell you.'\n",

      "Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain. Down in the yard\n",
      "the red-armed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub and\n",

      "\n",
      "  They sye that time 'eals all things,\n",

      "  They twist my 'eart-strings yet!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew the whole drivelling song by heart, it seemed. Her voice floated\n",
      "upward with the sweet summer air, very tuneful, charged with a sort of\n",
      "happy melancholy. One had the feeling that she would have been perfectly\n",
      "content, if the June evening had been endless and the supply of clothes\n",
      "inexhaustible, to remain there for a thousand years, pegging out diapers\n",
      "and singing rubbish. It struck him as a curious fact that he had never\n",
      "heard a member of the Party singing alone and spontaneously. It would even\n",
      "have seemed slightly unorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to\n",
      "oneself. Perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation\n",
      "level that they had anything to sing about.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You can turn round now,' said Julia.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned round, and for a second almost failed to recognize her. What he\n",
      "had actually expected was to see her naked. But she was not naked. The\n",
      "transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that. She\n",
      "had painted her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought\n",
      "herself a complete set of make-up materials. Her lips were deeply reddened,\n",
      "her cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even a touch of something\n",
      "under the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skilfully done, but\n",
      "Winston's standards in such matters were not high. He had never before\n",
      "seen or imagined a woman of the Party with cosmetics on her face. The\n",
      "improvement in her appearance was startling. With just a few dabs of colour\n",
      "in the right places she had become not only very much prettier, but, above\n",
      "all, far more feminine. Her short hair and boyish overalls merely added\n",
      "to the effect. As he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violets\n",
      "flooded his nostrils. He remembered the half-darkness of a basement\n",
      "kitchen, and a woman's cavernous mouth. It was the very same scent that\n",
      "she had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Scent too!' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I'm going to do next? I'm\n",
      "going to get hold of a real woman's frock from somewhere and wear it\n",
      "instead of these bloody trousers. I'll wear silk stockings and high-heeled\n",
      "shoes! In this room I'm going to be a woman, not a Party comrade.'\n",
      "\n",
      "They flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed. It\n",
      "was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence.\n",
      "Until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body, with\n",
      "the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch\n",
      "over his ankle. There were no sheets, but the blanket they lay on was\n",
      "threadbare and smooth, and the size and springiness of the bed astonished\n",
      "both of them. 'It's sure to be full of bugs, but who cares?' said Julia.\n",
      "One never saw a double bed nowadays, except in the homes of the proles.\n",
      "Winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood: Julia had never been\n",
      "in one before, so far as she could remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently they fell asleep for a little while. When Winston woke up the\n",
      "hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine. He did not stir, because\n",
      "Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. Most of her\n",
      "make-up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a light\n",
      "stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. A yellow ray\n",
      "from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the\n",
      "fireplace, where the water in the pan was boiling fast. Down in the yard\n",
      "the woman had stopped singing, but the faint shouts of children floated in\n",
      "from the street. He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had\n",
      "been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the cool of a summer\n",
      "evening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making love when they chose,\n",
      "talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply\n",
      "lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely there could\n",
      "never have been a time when that seemed ordinary? Julia woke up, rubbed\n",
      "her eyes, and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Half that water's boiled away,' she said. 'I'll get up and make some\n",
      "coffee in another moment. We've got an hour. What time do they cut the\n",
      "lights off at your flats?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Twenty-three thirty.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's twenty-three at the hostel. But you have to get in earlier than that,\n",
      "because--Hi! Get out, you filthy brute!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a shoe from the floor,\n",
      "and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm, exactly\n",
      "as he had seen her fling the dictionary at Goldstein, that morning during\n",
      "the Two Minutes Hate.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What was it?' he said in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A rat. I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting. There's a\n",
      "hole down there. I gave him a good fright, anyway.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Rats!' murmured Winston. 'In this room!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'They're all over the place,' said Julia indifferently as she lay down\n",
      "again. 'We've even got them in the kitchen at the hostel. Some parts of\n",
      "London are swarming with them. Did you know they attack children? Yes,\n",
      "they do. In some of these streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone for\n",
      "two minutes. It's the great huge brown ones that do it. And the nasty\n",
      "thing is that the brutes always----'\n",
      "\n",
      "'DON'T GO ON!' said Winston, with his eyes tightly shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Dearest! You've gone quite pale. What's the matter? Do they make you feel\n",
      "sick?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of all horrors in the world--a rat!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him, as though\n",
      "to reassure him with the warmth of her body. He did not reopen his eyes\n",
      "immediately. For several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a\n",
      "nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life. It was\n",
      "always very much the same. He was standing in front of a wall of darkness,\n",
      "and on the other side of it there was something unendurable, something too\n",
      "dreadful to be faced. In the dream his deepest feeling was always one of\n",
      "self-deception, because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of\n",
      "darkness. With a deadly effort, like wrenching a piece out of his own\n",

      "meals and which contained, among other things, an unbelievably ancient\n",

      "of poor Cock Robin. 'It just occurred to me you might be interested,' he\n",

      "difficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. It was as when\n",
      "Winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling that\n",
      "it would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside\n",

      "of finding one's way into it. He told her of the strange intimacy that\n",
      "existed, or seemed to exist, between himself and O'Brien, and of the\n",
      "impulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into O'Brien's presence, announce\n",
      "that he was the enemy of the Party, and demand his help. Curiously enough,\n",
      "this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do. She was used to\n",
      "judging people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her that Winston\n",
      "should believe O'Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash\n",
      "of the eyes. Moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearly\n",
      "everyone, secretly hated the Party and would break the rules if he thought\n",
      "it safe to do so. But she refused to believe that widespread, organized\n",

      "had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe\n",
      "in. Times beyond number, at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations,\n",
      "she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose\n",
      "names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the\n",
      "faintest belief. When public trials were happening she had taken her place\n",
      "in the detachments from the Youth League who surrounded the courts from\n",
      "morning to night, chanting at intervals 'Death to the traitors!' During\n",
      "the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults\n",
      "at Goldstein. Yet she had only the dimmest idea of who Goldstein was and\n",
      "what doctrines he was supposed to represent. She had grown up since the\n",
      "Revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of the\n",
      "fifties and sixties. Such a thing as an independent political movement was\n",
      "outside her imagination: and in any case the Party was invincible. It\n",
      "would always exist, and it would always be the same. You could only rebel\n",
      "against it by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated acts of\n",
      "violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up.\n",

      "In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and far less susceptible\n",
      "to Party propaganda. Once when he happened in some connexion to mention\n",

      "London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, 'just to\n",

      "to him. She also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during\n",
      "the Two Minutes Hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out\n",
      "laughing. But she only questioned the teachings of the Party when they\n",
      "in some way touched upon her own life. Often she was ready to accept\n",
      "the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and\n",
      "falsehood did not seem important to her. She believed, for instance, having\n",
      "learnt it at school, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. (In his own\n",
      "schooldays, Winston remembered, in the late fifties, it was only the\n",
      "helicopter that the Party claimed to have invented; a dozen years later,\n",
      "when Julia was at school, it was already claiming the aeroplane; one\n",
      "generation more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) And when he\n",
      "told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long\n",
      "before the Revolution, the fact struck her as totally uninteresting. After\n",
      "all, what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes? It was rather more\n",
      "of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did\n",
      "not remember that Oceania, four years ago, had been at war with Eastasia\n",
      "and at peace with Eurasia. It was true that she regarded the whole war as\n",
      "a sham: but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy\n",
      "had changed. 'I thought we'd always been at war with Eurasia,' she said\n",
      "vaguely. It frightened him a little. The invention of aeroplanes dated\n",
      "from long before her birth, but the switchover in the war had happened\n",
      "only four years ago, well after she was grown up. He argued with her about\n",
      "it for perhaps a quarter of an hour. In the end he succeeded in forcing\n",
      "her memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time Eastasia and\n",
      "not Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issue still struck her as\n",
      "unimportant. 'Who cares?' she said impatiently. 'It's always one bloody\n",
      "war after another, and one knows the news is all lies anyway.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes he talked to her of the Records Department and the impudent\n",
      "forgeries that he committed there. Such things did not appear to horrify\n",
      "her. She did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought\n",
      "of lies becoming truths. He told her the story of Jones, Aaronson, and\n",
      "Rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between\n",
      "his fingers. It did not make much impression on her. At first, indeed, she\n",

      "when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence\n",
      "ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don't know\n",
      "with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories. Just in\n",

      "speaking to O'Brien, when the meaning of the words had sunk in, a chilly\n",
      "shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body. He had the sensation\n",

      "His father had disappeared some time earlier, how much earlier he could\n",

      "the time: the periodical panics about air-raids and the sheltering in Tube\n",
      "stations, the piles of rubble everywhere, the unintelligible proclamations\n",
      "posted at street corners, the gangs of youths in shirts all the same\n",
      "colour, the enormous queues outside the bakeries, the intermittent\n",
      "machine-gun fire in the distance--above all, the fact that there was\n",
      "never enough to eat. He remembered long afternoons spent with other boys\n",
      "in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps, picking out the ribs of\n",
      "cabbage leaves, potato peelings, sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust\n",
      "from which they carefully scraped away the cinders; and also in waiting\n",

      "in the fender, and a shelf where food was kept, and on the landing outside\n",
      "there was a brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. He remembered\n",
      "his mother's statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something\n",
      "in a saucepan. Above all he remembered his continuous hunger, and the\n",
      "fierce sordid battles at mealtimes. He would ask his mother naggingly,\n",
      "over and over again, why there was not more food, he would shout and storm\n",
      "at her (he even remembered the tones of his voice, which was beginning to\n",
      "break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he would\n",

      "took it for granted that he, 'the boy', should have the biggest portion;\n",
      "but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more. At every meal\n",
      "she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little\n",
      "sister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. He would cry out\n",
      "with rage when she stopped ladling, he would try to wrench the saucepan\n",
      "and spoon out of her hands, he would grab bits from his sister's plate.\n",
      "He knew that he was starving the other two, but he could not help it; he\n",
      "even felt that he had a right to do it. The clamorous hunger in his belly\n",

      "\n",
      "One day a chocolate ration was issued. There had been no such issue for\n",

      "morsel of chocolate. It was a two-ounce slab (they still talked about\n",
      "ounces in those days) between the three of them. It was obvious that it\n",
      "ought to be divided into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though he were\n",
      "listening to somebody else, Winston heard himself demanding in a loud\n",
      "booming voice that he should be given the whole piece. His mother told him\n",
      "not to be greedy. There was a long, nagging argument that went round and\n",
      "round, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings. His tiny\n",
      "sister, clinging to her mother with both hands, exactly like a baby monkey,\n",
      "sat looking over her shoulder at him with large, mournful eyes. In the\n",
      "end his mother broke off three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it to\n",
      "Winston, giving the other quarter to his sister. The little girl took hold\n",
      "of it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was. Winston\n",
      "stood watching her for a moment. Then with a sudden swift spring he had\n",

      "his face. Even now he was thinking about the thing, he did not know what\n",
      "it was that was on the point of happening. His sister, conscious of having\n",
      "been robbed of something, had set up a feeble wail. His mother drew her\n",
      "arm round the child and pressed its face against her breast. Something in\n",
      "the gesture told him that his sister was dying. He turned and fled down\n",
      "the stairs, with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "He never saw his mother again. After he had devoured the chocolate he felt\n",
      "somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several\n",
      "hours, until hunger drove him home. When he came back his mother had\n",
      "disappeared. This was already becoming normal at that time. Nothing was\n",
      "gone from the room except his mother and his sister. They had not taken\n",
      "any clothes, not even his mother's overcoat. To this day he did not know\n",
      "with any certainty that his mother was dead. It was perfectly possible\n",
      "that she had merely been sent to a forced-labour camp. As for his sister,\n",
      "she might have been removed, like Winston himself, to one of the colonies\n",
      "for homeless children (Reclamation Centres, they were called) which had\n",
      "grown up as a result of the civil war, or she might have been sent to the\n",

      "to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the enveloping protecting\n",
      "gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained. His\n",
      "mind went back to another dream of two months ago. Exactly as his mother\n",
      "had sat on the dingy white-quilted bed, with the child clinging to her, so\n",
      "she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath him, and drowning deeper\n",
      "every minute, but still looking up at him through the darkening water.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told Julia the story of his mother's disappearance. Without opening her\n",
      "eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,' she said\n",

      "'Yes. But the real point of the story----'\n",
      "\n",
      "From her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again.\n",
      "He would have liked to continue talking about his mother. He did not\n",
      "suppose, from what he could remember of her, that she had been an unusual\n",
      "woman, still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of\n",
      "nobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that she obeyed\n",
      "were private ones. Her feelings were her own, and could not be altered\n",
      "from outside. It would not have occurred to her that an action which is\n",
      "ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. If you loved someone, you loved\n",
      "him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love. When\n",
      "the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the child in\n",
      "her arms. It was no use, it changed nothing, it did not produce more\n",
      "chocolate, it did not avert the child's death or her own; but it seemed\n",
      "natural to her to do it. The refugee woman in the boat had also covered\n",
      "the little boy with her arm, which was no more use against the bullets\n",
      "than a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the Party had done was to\n",
      "persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while\n",
      "at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world. When\n",
      "once you were in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel,\n",
      "what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no difference.\n",
      "Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you nor your actions were ever\n",
      "heard of again. You were lifted clean out of the stream of history. And\n",
      "yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed\n",
      "all-important, because they were not attempting to alter history. They\n",
      "were governed by private loyalties which they did not question. What\n",
      "mattered were individual relationships, and a completely helpless gesture,\n",
      "an embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, could have value in\n",
      "itself. The proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in this\n",
      "condition. They were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, they\n",
      "were loyal to one another. For the first time in his life he did not\n",
      "despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would\n",
      "one day spring to life and regenerate the world. The proles had stayed\n",
      "human. They had not become hardened inside. They had held on to the\n",
      "primitive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious effort.\n",
      "And in thinking this he remembered, without apparent relevance, how a few\n",
      "weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked\n",
      "it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage-stalk.\n",
      "\n",

      "He thought for a little while. 'Has it ever occurred to you,' he said,\n",

      "\n",
      "'We've been lucky,' he said 'but it can't last much longer. You're young.\n",
      "You look normal and innocent. If you keep clear of people like me, you\n",
      "might stay alive for another fifty years.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No. I've thought it all out. What you do, I'm going to do. And don't be\n",
      "too downhearted. I'm rather good at staying alive.'\n",

      "shall be? When once they get hold of us there will be nothing, literally\n",
      "nothing, that either of us can do for the other. If I confess, they'll\n",
      "shoot you, and if I refuse to confess, they'll shoot you just the same.\n",

      "that a black-uniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner,\n",
      "demand his papers, and order him to get out. O'Brien's servant, however,\n",
      "had admitted the two of them without demur. He was a small, dark-haired\n",
      "man in a white jacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionless\n",
      "face which might have been that of a Chinese. The passage down which he\n",
      "led them was softly carpeted, with cream-papered walls and white\n",

      "\n",

      "usual, as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. The terror that\n",
      "Winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary\n",
      "embarrassment. It seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a\n",
      "stupid mistake. For what evidence had he in reality that O'Brien was any\n",
      "kind of political conspirator? Nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single\n",
      "equivocal remark: beyond that, only his own secret imaginings, founded on\n",
      "a dream. He could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to\n",
      "borrow the dictionary, because in that case Julia's presence was impossible\n",
      "to explain. As O'Brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike\n",

      "a sharp snap. The voice had stopped.\n",

      "He was opposite them now. His solid form towered over the pair of them,\n",
      "and the expression on his face was still indecipherable. He was waiting,\n",
      "somewhat sternly, for Winston to speak, but about what? Even now it was\n",
      "quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he\n",
      "had been interrupted. Nobody spoke. After the stopping of the telescreen\n",
      "the room seemed deadly silent. The seconds marched past, enormous. With\n",
      "difficulty Winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on O'Brien's. Then\n",
      "suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings\n",
      "of a smile. With his characteristic gesture O'Brien resettled his\n",

      "\n",
      "'Shall I say it, or will you?' he said.\n",

      "'We have come here because----'\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness of\n",
      "his own motives. Since he did not in fact know what kind of\n",
      "help he expected from O'Brien, it was not easy to say why he\n",
      "had come here. He went on, conscious that what he was saying\n",

      "'We believe that there is some kind of conspiracy, some kind of secret\n",
      "organization working against the Party, and that you are involved in it.\n",
      "We want to join it and work for it. We are enemies of the Party. We\n",
      "disbelieve in the principles of Ingsoc. We are thought-criminals. We are\n",
      "also adulterers. I tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your\n",
      "mercy. If you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way, we are\n",
      "ready.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the feeling that the door\n",
      "had opened. Sure enough, the little yellow-faced servant had come in\n",
      "without knocking. Winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter\n",
      "and glasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Martin is one of us,' said O'Brien impassively. 'Bring the drinks over\n",
      "here, Martin. Put them on the round table. Have we enough chairs? Then\n",
      "we may as well sit down and talk in comfort. Bring a chair for yourself,\n",
      "Martin. This is business. You can stop being a servant for the next ten\n",
      "minutes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still with a\n",
      "servant-like air, the air of a valet enjoying a privilege. Winston\n",
      "regarded him out of the corner of his eye. It struck him that the man's\n",
      "whole life was playing a part, and that he felt it to be dangerous to\n",
      "drop his assumed personality even for a moment. O'Brien took the decanter\n",
      "by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. It aroused\n",
      "in Winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a\n",
      "hoarding--a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move\n",
      "up and down and pour its contents into a glass. Seen from the top the\n",
      "stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby.\n",
      "It had a sour-sweet smell. He saw Julia pick up her glass and sniff at\n",
      "it with frank curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is called wine,' said O'Brien with a faint smile. 'You will have read\n",
      "about it in books, no doubt. Not much of it gets to the Outer Party, I am\n",
      "afraid.' His face grew solemn again, and he raised his glass: 'I think it\n",
      "is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health. To our Leader: To\n",
      "Emmanuel Goldstein.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. Wine was a thing he\n",
      "had read and dreamed about. Like the glass paperweight or Mr Charrington's\n",
      "half-remembered rhymes, it belonged to the vanished, romantic past, the\n",
      "olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. For some reason\n",
      "he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste, like\n",
      "that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect. Actually,\n",
      "when he came to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly disappointing. The\n",
      "truth was that after years of gin-drinking he could barely taste it. He\n",
      "set down the empty glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then there is such a person as Goldstein?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, there is such a person, and he is alive. Where, I do not know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And the conspiracy--the organization? Is it real? It is not simply an\n",
      "invention of the Thought Police?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, it is real. The Brotherhood, we call it. You will never learn much\n",
      "more about the Brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it.\n",
      "I will come back to that presently.' He looked at his wrist-watch. 'It is\n",
      "unwise even for members of the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen for\n",
      "more than half an hour. You ought not to have come here together, and\n",
      "you will have to leave separately. You, comrade'--he bowed his head to\n",
      "Julia--'will leave first. We have about twenty minutes at our disposal.\n",
      "You will understand that I must start by asking you certain questions.\n",
      "In general terms, what are you prepared to do?'\n",

      "Winston. He almost ignored Julia, seeming to take it for granted that\n",
      "Winston could speak for her. For a moment the lids flitted down over his\n",
      "eyes. He began asking his questions in a low, expressionless voice, as\n",
      "though this were a routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answers\n",
      "were known to him already.\n",

      "'Yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are prepared to cheat, to forge, to blackmail, to corrupt the minds\n",
      "of children, to distribute habit-forming drugs, to encourage prostitution,\n",

      "It appeared to Winston that a long time passed before he answered. For a\n",

      "then of the other, over and over again. Until he had said it, he did not\n",
      "know which word he was going to say. 'No,' he said finally.\n",

      "'You did well to tell me,' said O'Brien. 'It is necessary for us to know\n",
      "everything.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned himself toward Julia and added in a voice with somewhat more\n",
      "expression in it:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you understand that even if he survives, it may be as a different\n",
      "person? We may be obliged to give him a new identity. His face, his\n",
      "movements, the shape of his hands, the colour of his hair--even his voice\n",
      "would be different. And you yourself might have become a different person.\n",
      "Our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. Sometimes it is\n",
      "necessary. Sometimes we even amputate a limb.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at Martin's\n",
      "Mongolian face. There were no scars that he could see. Julia had turned a\n",
      "shade paler, so that her freckles were showing, but she faced O'Brien\n",
      "boldly. She murmured something that seemed to be assent.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Good. Then that is settled.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. With a rather\n",
      "absent-minded air O'Brien pushed them towards the others, took one himself,\n",
      "then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro, as though he could think\n",
      "better standing. They were very good cigarettes, very thick and\n",
      "well-packed, with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper. O'Brien looked at\n",
      "his wrist-watch again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You had better go back to your Pantry, Martin,' he said. 'I shall switch\n",
      "on in a quarter of an hour. Take a good look at these comrades' faces\n",
      "before you go. You will be seeing them again. I may not.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly as they had done at the front door, the little man's dark eyes\n",
      "flickered over their faces. There was not a trace of friendliness in his\n",
      "manner. He was memorizing their appearance, but he felt no interest in\n",
      "them, or appeared to feel none. It occurred to Winston that a synthetic\n",
      "face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression. Without speaking\n",
      "or giving any kind of salutation, Martin went out, closing the door\n",
      "silently behind him. O'Brien was strolling up and down, one hand in the\n",
      "pocket of his black overalls, the other holding his cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You understand,' he said, 'that you will be fighting in the dark. You\n",
      "will always be in the dark. You will receive orders and you will obey them,\n",
      "without knowing why. Later I shall send you a book from which you will\n",
      "learn the true nature of the society we live in, and the strategy by which\n",
      "we shall destroy it. When you have read the book, you will be full members\n",
      "of the Brotherhood. But between the general aims that we are fighting for\n",
      "and the immediate tasks of the moment, you will never know anything. I\n",
      "tell you that the Brotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you whether it\n",
      "numbers a hundred members, or ten million. From your personal knowledge\n",
      "you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen. You\n",
      "will have three or four contacts, who will be renewed from time to time as\n",
      "they disappear. As this was your first contact, it will be preserved. When\n",
      "you receive orders, they will come from me. If we find it necessary to\n",
      "communicate with you, it will be through Martin. When you are finally\n",
      "caught, you will confess. That is unavoidable. But you will have very\n",
      "little to confess, other than your own actions. You will not be able to\n",
      "betray more than a handful of unimportant people. Probably you will not\n",
      "even betray me. By that time I may be dead, or I shall have become a\n",
      "different person, with a different face.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet. In spite of the\n",
      "bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements. It\n",
      "came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket,\n",
      "or manipulated a cigarette. More even than of strength, he gave an\n",
      "impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony. However\n",
      "much in earnest he might be, he had nothing of the single-mindedness that\n",
      "belongs to a fanatic. When he spoke of murder, suicide, venereal disease,\n",
      "amputated limbs, and altered faces, it was with a faint air of persiflage.\n",
      "'This is unavoidable,' his voice seemed to say; 'this is what we have got\n",
      "to do, unflinchingly. But this is not what we shall be doing when life is\n",
      "worth living again.' A wave of admiration, almost of worship, flowed out\n",
      "from Winston towards O'Brien. For the moment he had forgotten the shadowy\n",
      "figure of Goldstein. When you looked at O'Brien's powerful shoulders and\n",
      "his blunt-featured face, so ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible\n",
      "to believe that he could be defeated. There was no stratagem that he was\n",
      "not equal to, no danger that he could not foresee. Even Julia seemed to\n",
      "be impressed. She had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently.\n",
      "O'Brien went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "'You will have heard rumours of the existence of the Brotherhood. No doubt\n",
      "you have formed your own picture of it. You have imagined, probably, a\n",
      "huge underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling\n",
      "messages on walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by special\n",
      "movements of the hand. Nothing of the kind exists. The members of the\n",
      "Brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another, and it is impossible\n",
      "for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others.\n",
      "Goldstein himself, if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police, could\n",
      "not give them a complete list of members, or any information that would\n",
      "lead them to a complete list. No such list exists. The Brotherhood cannot\n",
      "be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense.\n",
      "Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible. You\n",
      "will never have anything to sustain you, except the idea. You will get no\n",
      "comradeship and no encouragement. When finally you are caught, you will\n",
      "get no help. We never help our members. At most, when it is absolutely\n",
      "necessary that someone should be silenced, we are occasionally able to\n",
      "smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner's cell. You will have to get used\n",
      "to living without results and without hope. You will work for a while,\n",
      "you will be caught, you will confess, and then you will die. Those are\n",
      "the only results that you will ever see. There is no possibility that any\n",
      "perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime. We are the dead.\n",
      "Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls\n",
      "of dust and splinters of bone. But how far away that future may be, there\n",
      "is no knowing. It might be a thousand years. At present nothing is possible\n",
      "except to extend the area of sanity little by little. We cannot act\n",
      "collectively. We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to\n",
      "individual, generation after generation. In the face of the Thought Police\n",
      "there is no other way.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He halted and looked for the third time at his wrist-watch.\n",
      "\n",

      "The decanter is still half full.'\n",

      "Any message? Any question?.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston thought. There did not seem to be any further question that he\n",
      "wanted to ask: still less did he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding\n",
      "generalities. Instead of anything directly connected with O'Brien or the\n",
      "Brotherhood, there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the\n",

      "the bones of Winston's palm. At the door Winston looked back, but O'Brien\n",

      "come into his head spontaneously. His body seemed to have not only the\n",
      "weakness of a jelly, but its translucency. He felt that if he held up his\n",
      "hand he would be able to see the light through it. All the blood and\n",
      "lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work, leaving\n",
      "only a frail structure of nerves, bones, and skin. All sensations seemed\n",
      "to be magnified. His overalls fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickled\n",

      "of Mr Charrington's shop, keeping one eye open for the patrols, but\n",
      "irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone\n",

      "against his knee at each step, sending a tingling sensation up and down\n",

      "quivering to its climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had boiled up\n",
      "into such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the\n",
      "2,000 Eurasian war-criminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last\n",
      "day of the proceedings, they would unquestionably have torn them to\n",

      "demonstration in one of the central London squares at the moment when it\n",
      "happened. It was night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners were\n",
      "luridly floodlit. The square was packed with several thousand people,\n",
      "including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the\n",
      "Spies. On a scarlet-draped platform an orator of the Inner Party, a small\n",
      "lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull over\n",
      "which a few lank locks straggled, was haranguing the crowd. A little\n",
      "Rumpelstiltskin figure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the\n",
      "microphone with one hand while the other, enormous at the end of a bony\n",
      "arm, clawed the air menacingly above his head. His voice, made metallic by\n",
      "the amplifiers, boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres,\n",
      "deportations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing of\n",
      "civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken treaties. It was\n",
      "almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then\n",
      "maddened. At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the\n",
      "voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose\n",
      "uncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most savage yells of all\n",
      "came from the schoolchildren. The speech had been proceeding for perhaps\n",
      "twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of\n",
      "paper was slipped into the speaker's hand. He unrolled and read it without\n",
      "pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voice or manner, or in the\n",
      "content of what he was saying, but suddenly the names were different.\n",
      "Without words said, a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd.\n",
      "Oceania was at war with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremendous\n",
      "commotion. The banners and posters with which the square was decorated\n",
      "were all wrong! Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them. It was\n",
      "sabotage! The agents of Goldstein had been at work! There was a riotous\n",
      "interlude while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to shreds\n",
      "and trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prodigies of activity in\n",
      "clambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from\n",
      "the chimneys. But within two or three minutes it was all over. The orator,\n",
      "still gripping the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward,\n",
      "his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his speech.\n",
      "One minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the\n",
      "crowd. The Hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had\n",
      "been changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker had\n",
      "switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence, not only\n",
      "without a pause, but without even breaking the syntax. But at the moment\n",
      "he had other things to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of disorder\n",
      "while the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not\n",
      "see had tapped him on the shoulder and said, 'Excuse me, I think you've\n",
      "dropped your brief-case.' He took the brief-case abstractedly, without\n",
      "speaking. He knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to\n",
      "look inside it. The instant that the demonstration was over he went\n",
      "straight to the Ministry of Truth, though the time was now nearly\n",
      "twenty-three hours. The entire staff of the Ministry had done likewise.\n",
      "The orders already issuing from the telescreen, recalling them to their\n",
      "posts, were hardly necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with\n",
      "Eastasia. A large part of the political literature of five years was now\n",
      "completely obsolete. Reports and records of all kinds, newspapers, books,\n",
      "pamphlets, films, sound-tracks, photographs--all had to be rectified at\n",
      "lightning speed. Although no directive was ever issued, it was known that\n",
      "the chiefs of the Department intended that within one week no reference\n",
      "to the war with Eurasia, or the alliance with Eastasia, should remain in\n",
      "existence anywhere. The work was overwhelming, all the more so because\n",
      "the processes that it involved could not be called by their true\n",
      "names. Everyone in the Records Department worked eighteen hours in the\n",
      "twenty-four, with two three-hour snatches of sleep. Mattresses were brought\n",
      "up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals consisted of\n",
      "sandwiches and Victory Coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from\n",
      "the canteen. Each time that Winston broke off for one of his spells of\n",
      "sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work, and each time that he\n",
      "crawled back sticky-eyed and aching, it was to find that another shower\n",
      "of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift, half-burying the\n",
      "speakwrite and overflowing on to the floor, so that the first job was\n",
      "always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work.\n",
      "What was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical.\n",
      "Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another, but any\n",
      "detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the\n",
      "geographical knowledge that one needed in transferring the war from one\n",
      "part of the world to another was considerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wiping\n",
      "every few minutes. It was like struggling with some crushing physical task,\n",
      "something which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless\n",
      "neurotically anxious to accomplish. In so far as he had time to remember\n",
      "it, he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the\n",
      "speakwrite, every stroke of his ink-pencil, was a deliberate lie. He was\n",
      "as anxious as anyone else in the Department that the forgery should be\n",
      "perfect. On the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed\n",
      "down. For as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube; then one\n",
      "more cylinder, then nothing. Everywhere at about the same time the work\n",
      "was easing off. A deep and as it were secret sigh went through the\n",
      "Department. A mighty deed, which could never be mentioned, had been\n",
      "achieved. It was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary\n",
      "evidence that the war with Eurasia had ever happened. At twelve hundred it\n",

      "Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age,\n",
      "there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle,\n",
      "and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne\n",
      "countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their\n",

      "War is Peace\n",
      "\n",
      "The splitting up of the world into three great super-states was an event\n",
      "which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth\n",
      "century. With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire\n",
      "by the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia and\n",
      "Oceania, were already effectively in being. The third, Eastasia, only\n",
      "emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting. The\n",
      "frontiers between the three super-states are in some places arbitrary, and\n",
      "in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general\n",
      "they follow geographical lines. Eurasia comprises the whole of the northern\n",
      "part of the European and Asiatic land-mass, from Portugal to the Bering\n",
      "Strait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the Atlantic islands including the\n",
      "British Isles, Australasia, and the southern portion of Africa. Eastasia,\n",
      "smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier,\n",
      "comprises China and the countries to the south of it, the Japanese islands\n",
      "and a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one combination or another, these three super-states are permanently at\n",
      "war, and have been so for the past twenty-five years. War, however, is no\n",
      "longer the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was in the early\n",
      "decades of the twentieth century. It is a warfare of limited aims between\n",
      "combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause\n",
      "for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference.\n",
      "This is not to say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailing\n",
      "attitude towards it, has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous.\n",
      "On the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries,\n",
      "and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction\n",
      "of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners which\n",
      "extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal,\n",
      "and, when they are committed by one's own side and not by the enemy,\n",
      "meritorious. But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of\n",
      "people, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively few\n",
      "casualties. The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague\n",
      "frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at, or round\n",
      "the Floating Fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. In\n",
      "the centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage\n",
      "of consumption goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may\n",
      "cause a few scores of deaths. War has in fact changed its character. More\n",
      "exactly, the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of\n",
      "importance. Motives which were already present to some small extent in the\n",
      "great wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and\n",
      "are consciously recognized and acted upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand the nature of the present war--for in spite of the regrouping\n",
      "which occurs every few years, it is always the same war--one must realize\n",
      "in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. None of\n",
      "the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other\n",
      "two in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their natural defences\n",
      "are too formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces, Oceania\n",
      "by the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity\n",
      "and industriousness of its inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in\n",
      "a material sense, anything to fight about. With the establishment of\n",
      "self-contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared\n",
      "to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of\n",
      "previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials\n",
      "is no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the three\n",
      "super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that\n",
      "it needs within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct\n",
      "economic purpose, it is a war for labour power. Between the frontiers of\n",
      "the super-states, and not permanently in the possession of any of them,\n",
      "there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville,\n",
      "Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it about a fifth of the population\n",
      "of the earth. It is for the possession of these thickly-populated regions,\n",
      "and of the northern ice-cap, that the three powers are constantly\n",
      "struggling. In practice no one power ever controls the whole of the\n",
      "disputed area. Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and it is the\n",
      "chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery\n",
      "that dictates the endless changes of alignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, and some of\n",
      "them yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder\n",

      "Moreover, the labour of the exploited peoples round the Equator is not\n",
      "really necessary to the world's economy. They add nothing to the wealth of\n",

      "The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of\n",
      "DOUBLETHINK, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by\n",
      "the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the\n",
      "machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end\n",
      "of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of\n",
      "consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when\n",
      "few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not\n",
      "urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes\n",
      "of destruction had been at work. The world of today is a bare, hungry,\n",
      "dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914, and\n",
      "still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of\n",
      "that period looked forward. In the early twentieth century, the vision of\n",
      "a future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, and efficient--a\n",
      "glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete--was\n",
      "part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person. Science and\n",
      "technology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to\n",
      "assume that they would go on developing. This failed to happen, partly\n",
      "because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and\n",
      "revolutions, partly because scientific and technical progress depended on\n",
      "the empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictly\n",
      "regimented society. As a whole the world is more primitive today than it\n",
      "was fifty years ago. Certain backward areas have advanced, and various\n",
      "devices, always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage,\n",
      "have been developed, but experiment and invention have largely stopped,\n",
      "and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never been\n",
      "fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still\n",
      "there. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it\n",
      "was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and\n",
      "therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the\n",
      "machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt,\n",
      "illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations.\n",
      "And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of\n",
      "automatic process--by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible\n",
      "not to distribute--the machine did raise the living standards of the\n",
      "average human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at\n",
      "the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the\n",
      "destruction--indeed, in some sense was the destruction--of a hierarchical\n",
      "society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to\n",
      "eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed\n",
      "a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most\n",
      "important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once\n",
      "became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no\n",
      "doubt, to imagine a society in which WEALTH, in the sense of personal\n",
      "possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while POWER\n",
      "remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such\n",
      "a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were\n",
      "enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally\n",
      "stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for\n",
      "themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later\n",
      "realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep\n",
      "it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a\n",
      "basis of poverty and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, as\n",
      "some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of\n",
      "doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency\n",
      "towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost\n",
      "the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially\n",
      "backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated,\n",
      "directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by\n",
      "restricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during\n",
      "the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy\n",
      "of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation,\n",
      "capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were\n",
      "prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this,\n",
      "too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted\n",
      "were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was\n",
      "how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real\n",
      "wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be\n",
      "distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by\n",
      "continuous warfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives,\n",
      "but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces,\n",
      "or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea,\n",
      "materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable,\n",
      "and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are\n",
      "not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of\n",
      "expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed.\n",
      "A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that\n",
      "would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as\n",
      "obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with\n",
      "further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle\n",
      "the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might\n",
      "exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs\n",
      "of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is\n",
      "a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on\n",
      "as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups\n",
      "somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity\n",
      "increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the\n",
      "distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early\n",
      "twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere,\n",
      "laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy\n",
      "his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the\n",
      "better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three\n",
      "servants, his private motor-car or helicopter--set him in a different world\n",
      "from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have\n",
      "a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call\n",
      "'the proles'. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the\n",
      "possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and\n",
      "poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and\n",
      "therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste\n",
      "seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but\n",
      "accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle it would\n",
      "be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building\n",
      "temples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even\n",
      "by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. But\n",
      "this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a\n",
      "hierarchical society. What is concerned here is not the morale of masses,\n",
      "whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work,\n",
      "but the morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member is\n",
      "expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow\n",
      "limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant\n",
      "fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic\n",
      "triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality\n",
      "appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is\n",
      "actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does\n",
      "not matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is\n",
      "that a state of war should exist. The splitting of the intelligence which\n",
      "the Party requires of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an\n",
      "atmosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higher up the ranks\n",
      "one goes, the more marked it becomes. It is precisely in the Inner Party\n",
      "that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest. In his capacity\n",
      "as an administrator, it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party\n",
      "to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and he may often\n",
      "be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or\n",
      "is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones: but such\n",
      "knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of DOUBLETHINK. Meanwhile\n",
      "no Inner Party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that\n",
      "the war is real, and that it is bound to end victoriously, with Oceania\n",
      "the undisputed master of the entire world.\n",
      "\n",
      "All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as an\n",
      "article of faith. It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more\n",
      "and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of\n",
      "power, or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The search\n",
      "for new weapons continues unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining\n",
      "activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any\n",
      "outlet. In Oceania at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has\n",
      "almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for 'Science'. The\n",
      "empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of\n",
      "the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of\n",
      "Ingsoc. And even technological progress only happens when its products can\n",
      "in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty. In all the useful\n",
      "arts the world is either standing still or going backwards. The fields are\n",
      "cultivated with horse-ploughs while books are written by machinery. But\n",
      "in matters of vital importance--meaning, in effect, war and police\n",
      "espionage--the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least\n",
      "tolerated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of\n",
      "the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent\n",
      "thought. There are therefore two great problems which the Party is\n",
      "concerned to solve. One is how to discover, against his will, what another\n",
      "human being is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred\n",
      "million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand. In\n",
      "so far as scientific research still continues, this is its subject matter.\n",
      "The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor,\n",
      "studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions,\n",
      "gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects of\n",
      "drugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or he is chemist,\n",
      "physicist, or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special\n",
      "subject as are relevant to the taking of life. In the vast laboratories\n",
      "of the Ministry of Peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in the\n",
      "Brazilian forests, or in the Australian desert, or on lost islands of\n",
      "the Antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. Some are\n",
      "concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars; others devise\n",
      "larger and larger rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and more\n",
      "and more impenetrable armour-plating; others search for new and deadlier\n",
      "gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities\n",
      "as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or for breeds of disease\n",
      "germs immunized against all possible antibodies; others strive to produce\n",
      "a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under\n",
      "the water, or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing-ship;\n",
      "others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun's rays\n",
      "through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space, or\n",
      "producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at\n",
      "the earth's centre.\n",
      "\n",
      "But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization, and none\n",
      "of the three super-states ever gains a significant lead on the others.\n",
      "What is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess, in the\n",
      "atomic bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any that their present\n",
      "researches are likely to discover. Although the Party, according to its\n",
      "habit, claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as\n",
      "early as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large scale about\n",
      "ten years later. At that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on\n",
      "industrial centres, chiefly in European Russia, Western Europe, and\n",
      "North America. The effect was to convince the ruling groups of all\n",
      "countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized\n",
      "society, and hence of their own power. Thereafter, although no formal\n",
      "agreement was ever made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All three\n",
      "powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against\n",
      "the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later.\n",
      "And meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or\n",
      "forty years. Helicopters are more used than they were formerly, bombing\n",
      "planes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles, and the\n",
      "fragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable Floating\n",
      "Fortress; but otherwise there has been little development. The tank, the\n",
      "submarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and the hand\n",
      "grenade are still in use. And in spite of the endless slaughters reported\n",
      "in the Press and on the telescreens, the desperate battles of earlier wars,\n",
      "in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed\n",
      "in a few weeks, have never been repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of the three super-states ever attempts any manoeuvre which involves\n",
      "the risk of serious defeat. When any large operation is undertaken, it is\n",
      "usually a surprise attack against an ally. The strategy that all three\n",
      "powers are following, or pretend to themselves that they are following,\n",
      "is the same. The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, and\n",
      "well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases completely\n",
      "encircling one or other of the rival states, and then to sign a pact of\n",
      "friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years\n",
      "as to lull suspicion to sleep. During this time rockets loaded with atomic\n",
      "bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they will all\n",
      "be fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliation\n",
      "impossible. It will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the\n",
      "remaining world-power, in preparation for another attack. This scheme, it\n",
      "is hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization.\n",
      "Moreover, no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the\n",
      "Equator and the Pole: no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken.\n",
      "This explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the\n",
      "super-states are arbitrary. Eurasia, for example, could easily conquer the\n",
      "British Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or on the other\n",
      "hand it would be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers to the Rhine\n",
      "or even to the Vistula. But this would violate the principle, followed on\n",
      "all sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity. If Oceania were\n",
      "to conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and Germany, it\n",
      "would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of great\n",
      "physical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of about a hundred\n",
      "million people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly on\n",
      "the Oceanic level. The problem is the same for all three super-states.\n",
      "It is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no\n",
      "contact with foreigners, except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners\n",
      "and coloured slaves. Even the official ally of the moment is always\n",
      "regarded with the darkest suspicion. War prisoners apart, the average\n",
      "citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or\n",
      "Eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If he\n",
      "were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are\n",
      "creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about\n",
      "them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the\n",
      "fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might\n",
      "evaporate. It is therefore realized on all sides that however often Persia,\n",
      "or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon may change hands, the main frontiers must\n",
      "never be crossed by anything except bombs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood and\n",
      "acted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three super-states\n",
      "are very much the same. In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called\n",
      "Ingsoc, in Eurasia it is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is\n",
      "called by a Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, but perhaps\n",
      "better rendered as Obliteration of the Self. The citizen of Oceania is not\n",
      "allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies, but\n",
      "he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and\n",
      "common sense. Actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable,\n",
      "and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all.\n",
      "Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same worship of\n",
      "semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous\n",
      "warfare. It follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer\n",
      "one another, but would gain no advantage by doing so. On the contrary,\n",
      "so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up, like three\n",
      "sheaves of corn. And, as usual, the ruling groups of all three powers are\n",
      "simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing. Their lives are\n",
      "dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that it is necessary that\n",
      "the war should continue everlastingly and without victory. Meanwhile the\n",
      "fact that there IS no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of\n",
      "reality which is the special feature of Ingsoc and its rival systems of\n",
      "thought. Here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, that\n",
      "by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character.\n",
      "\n",
      "In past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something that sooner or\n",
      "later came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or defeat. In the\n",
      "past, also, war was one of the main instruments by which human societies\n",
      "were kept in touch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages have tried\n",
      "to impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but they could\n",
      "not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military\n",
      "efficiency. So long as defeat meant the loss of independence, or some other\n",
      "result generally held to be undesirable, the precautions against defeat\n",
      "had to be serious. Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or\n",
      "religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when\n",
      "one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four. Inefficient\n",
      "nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle for\n",
      "efficiency was inimical to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it was\n",
      "necessary to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly\n",
      "accurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspapers and history\n",
      "books were, of course, always coloured and biased, but falsification of\n",
      "the kind that is practised today would have been impossible. War was a\n",
      "sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned\n",
      "it was probably the most important of all safeguards. While wars could be\n",
      "won or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases to be dangerous.\n",
      "When war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity.\n",
      "Technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or\n",
      "disregarded. As we have seen, researches that could be called scientific\n",
      "are still carried out for the purposes of war, but they are essentially a\n",
      "kind of daydreaming, and their failure to show results is not important.\n",
      "Efficiency, even military efficiency, is no longer needed. Nothing is\n",
      "efficient in Oceania except the Thought Police. Since each of the three\n",
      "super-states is unconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe within\n",
      "which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised. Reality\n",
      "only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life--the need to\n",
      "eat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or\n",

      "obvious to many observers. There then rose schools of thinkers who\n",
      "interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that\n",
      "inequality was the unalterable law of human life. This doctrine, of course,\n",
      "had always had its adherents, but in the manner in which it was now put\n",
      "forward there was a significant change. In the past the need for a\n",

      "use of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity. Now, however, the\n",
      "concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not\n",
      "yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so before long. In the\n",
      "past the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality, and\n",
      "then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown.\n",
      "The new Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand.\n",
      "Socialism, a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was\n",
      "the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions\n",
      "of antiquity, was still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages.\n",
      "But in each variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the\n",
      "aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly\n",
      "abandoned. The new movements which appeared in the middle years of the\n",
      "century, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-Worship, as\n",
      "it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aim of perpetuating\n",

      "intelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then it\n",
      "was alterable. But the principal, underlying cause was that, as early\n",
      "as the beginning of the twentieth century, human equality had become\n",
      "technically possible. It was still true that men were not equal in their\n",
      "native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that\n",
      "favoured some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real\n",
      "need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth. In earlier\n",
      "ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable.\n",
      "Inequality was the price of civilization. With the development of machine\n",
      "production, however, the case was altered. Even if it was still necessary\n",
      "for human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary\n",
      "for them to live at different social or economic levels. Therefore, from\n",
      "the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power,\n",
      "human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to\n",
      "be averted. In more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was\n",
      "in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it. The idea of\n",
      "an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of\n",
      "brotherhood, without laws and without brute labour, had haunted the human\n",
      "imagination for thousands of years. And this vision had had a certain hold\n",
      "even on the groups who actually profited by each historical change. The\n",
      "heirs of the French, English, and American revolutions had partly believed\n",
      "in their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of speech, equality\n",
      "before the law, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct to be\n",
      "influenced by them to some extent. But by the fourth decade of the\n",
      "twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were\n",
      "authoritarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the\n",
      "moment when it became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever\n",
      "name it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in the\n",
      "general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which\n",
      "had been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years--imprisonment\n",
      "without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions,\n",
      "torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation\n",
      "of whole populations--not only became common again, but were tolerated\n",
      "and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and\n",
      "progressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions, and\n",
      "counter-revolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals\n",
      "emerged as fully worked-out political theories. But they had been\n",
      "foreshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which\n",
      "had appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the world\n",
      "which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious. What\n",
      "kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious. The new\n",
      "aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists,\n",
      "technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists,\n",
      "teachers, journalists, and professional politicians. These people, whose\n",
      "origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the\n",
      "working class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of\n",
      "monopoly industry and centralized government. As compared with their\n",
      "opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by\n",
      "luxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what\n",
      "they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition. This last\n",
      "difference was cardinal. By comparison with that existing today, all the\n",
      "tyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient. The ruling groups\n",
      "were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to\n",
      "leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act and to be\n",
      "uninterested in what their subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic Church\n",
      "of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of the reason\n",
      "for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its\n",
      "citizens under constant surveillance. The invention of print, however,\n",
      "made it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and the radio\n",
      "carried the process further. With the development of television, and\n",
      "the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit\n",
      "simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end. Every\n",
      "citizen, or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching,\n",
      "could be kept for twenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police\n",
      "and in the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels of\n",
      "communication closed. The possibility of enforcing not only complete\n",
      "obedience to the will of the State, but complete uniformity of opinion\n",
      "on all subjects, now existed for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society\n",
      "regrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, and Low. But the new High\n",
      "group, unlike all its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what\n",
      "was needed to safeguard its position. It had long been realized that the\n",
      "only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and privilege\n",
      "are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The so-called\n",
      "'abolition of private property' which took place in the middle years of\n",
      "the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer\n",
      "hands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners were a\n",
      "group instead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of the\n",
      "Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings. Collectively, the\n",
      "Party owns everything in Oceania, because it controls everything, and\n",
      "disposes of the products as it thinks fit. In the years following the\n",
      "Revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost\n",
      "unopposed, because the whole process was represented as an act of\n",
      "collectivization. It had always been assumed that if the capitalist class\n",
      "were expropriated, Socialism must follow: and unquestionably the\n",
      "capitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land, houses,\n",
      "transport--everything had been taken away from them: and since these\n",
      "things were no longer private property, it followed that they must be\n",
      "public property. Ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier Socialist movement\n",
      "and inherited its phraseology, has in fact carried out the main item in\n",

      "that economic inequality has been made permanent.\n",

      "But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than\n",

      "the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented\n",
      "Middle group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and\n",
      "willingness to govern. These causes do not operate singly, and as a rule\n",
      "all four of them are present in some degree. A ruling class which could\n",
      "guard against all of them would remain in power permanently. Ultimately\n",
      "the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the middle of the present century, the first danger had in reality\n",
      "disappeared. Each of the three powers which now divide the world is in\n",
      "fact unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow\n",
      "demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert.\n",
      "The second danger, also, is only a theoretical one. The masses never\n",
      "revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are\n",
      "oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of\n",
      "comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed. The\n",
      "recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are\n",
      "not now permitted to happen, but other and equally large dislocations\n",
      "can and do happen without having political results, because there is no\n",
      "way in which discontent can become articulate. As for the problem of\n",
      "over-production, which has been latent in our society since the development\n",
      "of machine technique, it is solved by the device of continuous warfare\n",
      "(see Chapter III), which is also useful in keying up public morale to the\n",
      "necessary pitch. From the point of view of our present rulers, therefore,\n",
      "the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new group of able,\n",
      "under-employed, power-hungry people, and the growth of liberalism and\n",
      "scepticism in their own ranks. The problem, that is to say, is educational.\n",
      "It is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the\n",

      "a negative way.\n",

      "Given this background, one could infer, if one did not know it already,\n",

      "may be reasonably sure that he will never die, and there is already\n",
      "considerable uncertainty as to when he was born. Big Brother is the guise\n",
      "in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world. His function is\n",
      "to act as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which\n",
      "are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization.\n",
      "Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party. Its numbers limited to six\n",
      "millions, or something less than 2 per cent of the population of Oceania.\n",
      "Below the Inner Party comes the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is\n",
      "described as the brain of the State, may be justly likened to the hands.\n",

      "were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that\n",
      "would one day overturn the world. If there was hope, it lay in the proles!\n",
      "Without having read to the end of THE BOOK, he knew that that must be\n",
      "Goldstein's final message. The future belonged to the proles. And could he\n",
      "be sure that when their time came the world they constructed would not be\n",
      "just as alien to him, Winston Smith, as the world of the Party? Yes,\n",
      "because at the least it would be a world of sanity. Where there is\n",
      "equality there can be sanity. Sooner or later it would happen, strength\n",
      "would change into consciousness. The proles were immortal, you could not\n",
      "doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end\n",
      "their awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a\n",
      "thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds,\n",
      "passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share\n",
      "and could not kill.\n",

      "'Do you remember,' he said, 'the thrush that sang to us, that first day,\n",
      "at the edge of the wood?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He wasn't singing to us,' said Julia. 'He was singing to please himself.\n",
      "Not even that. He was just singing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The birds sang, the proles sang. the Party did not sing. All round the\n",
      "world, in London and New York, in Africa and Brazil, and in the mysterious,\n",
      "forbidden lands beyond the frontiers, in the streets of Paris and Berlin,\n",
      "in the villages of the endless Russian plain, in the bazaars of China and\n",
      "Japan--everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure, made monstrous\n",
      "by work and childbearing, toiling from birth to death and still singing.\n",
      "Out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come.\n",

      "\n",
      "They sprang apart. Winston's entrails seemed to have turned into ice. He\n",
      "could see the white all round the irises of Julia's eyes. Her face had\n",
      "turned a milky yellow. The smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbone\n",
      "stood out sharply, almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are the dead,' repeated the iron voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was behind the picture,' breathed Julia.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was behind the picture,' said the voice. 'Remain exactly where you\n",
      "are. Make no movement until you are ordered.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was starting, it was starting at last! They could do nothing except\n",
      "stand gazing into one another's eyes. To run for life, to get out of the\n",
      "house before it was too late--no such thought occurred to them. Unthinkable\n",
      "to disobey the iron voice from the wall. There was a snap as though a catch\n",
      "had been turned back, and a crash of breaking glass. The picture had fallen\n",
      "to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now they can see us,' said Julia.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now we can see you,' said the voice. 'Stand out in the middle of the\n",

      "one another.'\n",
      "\n",
      "They were not touching, but it seemed to him that he could feel Julia's\n",
      "body shaking. Or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own. He could\n",
      "just stop his teeth from chattering, but his knees were beyond his control.\n",
      "There was a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and outside.\n",
      "The yard seemed to be full of men. Something was being dragged across the\n",
      "stones. The woman's singing had stopped abruptly. There was a long, rolling\n",
      "clang, as though the washtub had been flung across the yard, and then a\n",
      "confusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The house is surrounded,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The house is surrounded,' said the voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard Julia snap her teeth together. 'I suppose we may as well say\n",
      "good-bye,' she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You may as well say good-bye,' said the voice. And then another quite\n",
      "different voice, a thin, cultivated voice which Winston had the impression\n",
      "of having heard before, struck in; 'And by the way, while we are on the\n",
      "subject, \"Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to\n",
      "chop off your head\"!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Something crashed on to the bed behind Winston's back. The head of a ladder\n",
      "had been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame. Someone was\n",
      "climbing through the window. There was a stampede of boots up the stairs.\n",
      "The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots on\n",
      "their feet and truncheons in their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes he barely moved. One\n",
      "thing alone mattered; to keep still, to keep still and not give them an\n",
      "excuse to hit you! A man with a smooth prize-fighter's jowl in which the\n",
      "mouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon\n",
      "meditatively between thumb and forefinger. Winston met his eyes. The\n",
      "feeling of nakedness, with one's hands behind one's head and one's face\n",
      "and body all exposed, was almost unbearable. The man protruded the tip\n",
      "of a white tongue, licked the place where his lips should have been, and\n",
      "then passed on. There was another crash. Someone had picked up the glass\n",
      "paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearth-stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from\n",
      "a cake, rolled across the mat. How small, thought Winston, how small it\n",
      "always was! There was a gasp and a thump behind him, and he received a\n",
      "violent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. One of\n",
      "the men had smashed his fist into Julia's solar plexus, doubling her up\n",
      "like a pocket ruler. She was thrashing about on the floor, fighting for\n",
      "breath. Winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre, but sometimes\n",
      "her livid, gasping face came within the angle of his vision. Even in his\n",
      "terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadly\n",
      "pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her\n",
      "breath. He knew what it was like; the terrible, agonizing pain which was\n",
      "there all the while but could not be suffered yet, because before all else\n",
      "it was necessary to be able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted her\n",
      "up by knees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like a sack.\n",
      "Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow and contorted, with\n",
      "the eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and that\n",
      "was the last he saw of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughts which came of their\n",
      "own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through his\n",
      "mind. He wondered whether they had got Mr Charrington. He wondered what\n",
      "they had done to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he badly wanted\n",
      "to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or\n",
      "three hours ago. He noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine,\n",
      "meaning twenty-one. But the light seemed too strong. Would not the light\n",
      "be fading at twenty-one hours on an August evening? He wondered whether\n",
      "after all he and Julia had mistaken the time--had slept the clock round\n",
      "and thought it was twenty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty\n",
      "on the following morning. But he did not pursue the thought further.\n",
      "It was not interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another, lighter step in the passage. Mr Charrington came into\n",
      "the room. The demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly became more\n",
      "subdued. Something had also changed in Mr Charrington's appearance. His\n",
      "eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Pick up those pieces,' he said sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man stooped to obey. The cockney accent had disappeared; Winston suddenly\n",
      "realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on the\n",
      "telescreen. Mr Charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket, but\n",
      "his hair, which had been almost white, had turned black. Also he was not\n",
      "wearing his spectacles. He gave Winston a single sharp glance, as though\n",
      "verifying his identity, and then paid no more attention to him. He was\n",
      "still recognizable, but he was not the same person any longer. His body\n",
      "had straightened, and seemed to have grown bigger. His face had undergone\n",
      "only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation.\n",
      "The black eyebrows were less bushy, the wrinkles were gone, the whole\n",
      "lines of the face seemed to have altered; even the nose seemed shorter. It\n",
      "was the alert, cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty. It occurred to\n",
      "Winston that for the first time in his life he was looking, with knowledge,\n",
      "at a member of the Thought Police.\n",

      "He did not know where he was. Presumably he was in the Ministry of Love,\n",
      "but there was no way of making certain. He was in a high-ceilinged\n",
      "windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain. Concealed lamps\n",
      "flooded it with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming sound\n",
      "which he supposed had something to do with the air supply. A bench, or\n",
      "shelf, just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall, broken only by the\n",
      "door and, at the end opposite the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden\n",
      "seat. There were four telescreens, one in each wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there ever since they\n",
      "had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away. But he was also\n",
      "hungry, with a gnawing, unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be twenty-four\n",
      "hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did not know,\n",
      "probably never would know, whether it had been morning or evening when\n",
      "they arrested him. Since he was arrested he had not been fed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his hands crossed\n",
      "on his knee. He had already learned to sit still. If you made unexpected\n",
      "movements they yelled at you from the telescreen. But the craving for food\n",
      "was growing upon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread.\n",
      "He had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his\n",
      "overalls. It was even possible--he thought this because from time to time\n",
      "something seemed to tickle his leg--that there might be a sizeable bit of\n",
      "crust there. In the end the temptation to find out overcame his fear; he\n",
      "slipped a hand into his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Smith!' yelled a voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W.! Hands out of\n",
      "pockets in the cells!'\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Before being brought\n",
      "here he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary\n",
      "prison or a temporary lock-up used by the patrols. He did not know how\n",
      "long he had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and no\n",
      "daylight it was hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil-smelling\n",
      "place. They had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in,\n",
      "but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people. The\n",
      "majority of them were common criminals, but there were a few political\n",
      "prisoners among them. He had sat silent against the wall, jostled by dirty\n",
      "bodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much\n",
      "interest in his surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing difference\n",
      "in demeanour between the Party prisoners and the others. The Party\n",
      "prisoners were always silent and terrified, but the ordinary criminals\n",
      "seemed to care nothing for anybody. They yelled insults at the guards,\n",
      "fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded, wrote obscene\n",
      "words on the floor, ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious\n",
      "hiding-places in their clothes, and even shouted down the telescreen when\n",
      "it tried to restore order. On the other hand some of them seemed to be on\n",
      "good terms with the guards, called them by nicknames, and tried to wheedle\n",
      "cigarettes through the spyhole in the door. The guards, too, treated the\n",
      "common criminals with a certain forbearance, even when they had to handle\n",
      "them roughly. There was much talk about the forced-labour camps to which\n",
      "most of the prisoners expected to be sent. It was 'all right' in the\n",
      "camps, he gathered, so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropes.\n",
      "There was bribery, favouritism, and racketeering of every kind, there was\n",
      "homosexuality and prostitution, there was even illicit alcohol distilled\n",
      "from potatoes. The positions of trust were given only to the common\n",
      "criminals, especially the gangsters and the murderers, who formed a sort\n",
      "of aristocracy. All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every description:\n",
      "drug-peddlers, thieves, bandits, black-marketeers, drunks, prostitutes.\n",
      "Some of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combine\n",
      "to suppress them. An enormous wreck of a woman, aged about sixty, with\n",
      "great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down\n",
      "in her struggles, was carried in, kicking and shouting, by four guards,\n",
      "who had hold of her one at each corner. They wrenched off the boots with\n",
      "which she had been trying to kick them, and dumped her down across\n",
      "Winston's lap, almost breaking his thigh-bones. The woman hoisted herself\n",
      "upright and followed them out with a yell of 'F---- bastards!' Then,\n",
      "noticing that she was sitting on something uneven, she slid off Winston's\n",
      "knees on to the bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Beg pardon, dearie,' she said. 'I wouldn't 'a sat on you, only the buggers\n",
      "put me there. They dono 'ow to treat a lady, do they?' She paused, patted\n",
      "her breast, and belched. 'Pardon,' she said, 'I ain't meself, quite.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thass better,' she said, leaning back with closed eyes. 'Never keep it\n",
      "down, thass what I say. Get it up while it's fresh on your stomach, like.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She revived, turned to have another look at Winston and seemed immediately\n",
      "to take a fancy to him. She put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew him\n",
      "towards her, breathing beer and vomit into his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Wass your name, dearie?' she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Smith,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Smith?' said the woman. 'Thass funny. My name's Smith too. Why,' she\n",
      "added sentimentally, 'I might be your mother!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She might, thought Winston, be his mother. She was about the right age and\n",
      "physique, and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twenty\n",
      "years in a forced-labour camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extent the ordinary\n",
      "criminals ignored the Party prisoners. 'The polITS,' they called them,\n",
      "with a sort of uninterested contempt. The Party prisoners seemed terrified\n",
      "of speaking to anybody, and above all of speaking to one another. Only\n",
      "once, when two Party members, both women, were pressed close together on\n",
      "the bench, he overheard amid the din of voices a few hurriedly-whispered\n",
      "words; and in particular a reference to something called 'room one-oh-one',\n",
      "which he did not understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here. The\n",
      "dull pain in his belly never went away, but sometimes it grew better and\n",
      "sometimes worse, and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly. When\n",
      "it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire for\n",
      "food. When it grew better, panic took hold of him. There were moments\n",
      "when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actuality\n",
      "that his heart galloped and his breath stopped. He felt the smash of\n",
      "truncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himself\n",
      "grovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through broken teeth. He\n",
      "hardly thought of Julia. He could not fix his mind on her. He loved her\n",
      "and would not betray her; but that was only a fact, known as he knew the\n",
      "rules of arithmetic. He felt no love for her, and he hardly even wondered\n",
      "what was happening to her. He thought oftener of O'Brien, with a flickering\n",
      "hope. O'Brien might know that he had been arrested. The Brotherhood, he\n",
      "had said, never tried to save its members. But there was the razor blade;\n",
      "they would send the razor blade if they could. There would be perhaps five\n",
      "seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. The blade would bite\n",
      "into him with a sort of burning coldness, and even the fingers that held\n",
      "it would be cut to the bone. Everything came back to his sick body, which\n",
      "shrank trembling from the smallest pain. He was not certain that he would\n",
      "use the razor blade even if he got the chance. It was more natural to exist\n",
      "from moment to moment, accepting another ten minutes' life even with the\n",
      "certainty that there was torture at the end of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the\n",
      "walls of the cell. It should have been easy, but he always lost count at\n",
      "some point or another. More often he wondered where he was, and what time\n",
      "of day it was. At one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight\n",
      "outside, and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. In\n",
      "this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned out.\n",
      "It was the place with no darkness: he saw now why O'Brien had seemed to\n",
      "recognize the allusion. In the Ministry of Love there were no windows. His\n",
      "cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall; it\n",
      "might be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He moved himself\n",
      "mentally from place to place, and tried to determine by the feeling of his\n",
      "body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a sound of marching boots outside. The steel door opened with\n",
      "a clang. A young officer, a trim black-uniformed figure who seemed to\n",
      "glitter all over with polished leather, and whose pale, straight-featured\n",
      "face was like a wax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He motioned\n",
      "to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading. The\n",
      "poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell. The door clanged shut again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side, as\n",
      "though having some idea that there was another door to go out of, and then\n",
      "began to wander up and down the cell. He had not yet noticed Winston's\n",
      "presence. His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre above\n",
      "the level of Winston's head. He was shoeless; large, dirty toes were\n",
      "sticking out of the holes in his socks. He was also several days away\n",
      "from a shave. A scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones, giving\n",
      "him an air of ruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame and\n",
      "nervous movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston roused himself a little from his lethargy. He must speak\n",
      "to Ampleforth, and risk the yell from the telescreen. It was even\n",
      "conceivable that Ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ampleforth,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforth paused, mildly startled.\n",
      "His eyes focused themselves slowly on Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, Smith!' he said. 'You too!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What are you in for?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'To tell you the truth--' He sat down awkwardly on the bench opposite\n",
      "Winston. 'There is only one offence, is there not?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And have you committed it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Apparently I have.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment, as\n",
      "though trying to remember something.\n",
      "\n",
      "'These things happen,' he began vaguely. 'I have been able to recall one\n",
      "instance--a possible instance. It was an indiscretion, undoubtedly. We\n",
      "were producing a definitive edition of the poems of Kipling. I allowed the\n",
      "word \"God\" to remain at the end of a line. I could not help it!' he added\n",
      "almost indignantly, raising his face to look at Winston. 'It was impossible\n",
      "to change the line. The rhyme was \"rod\". Do you realize that there are only\n",
      "twelve rhymes to \"rod\" in the entire language? For days I had racked my\n",
      "brains. There WAS no other rhyme.'\n",

      "The expression on his face changed. The annoyance passed out of it and for\n",
      "a moment he looked almost pleased. A sort of intellectual warmth, the joy\n",

      "and scrubby hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Has it ever occurred to you,' he said, 'that the whole history of English\n",

      "\n",
      "No, that particular thought had never occurred to Winston. Nor, in the\n",
      "circumstances, did it strike him as very important or interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you know what time of day it is?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ampleforth looked startled again. 'I had hardly thought about it. They\n",

      "'There is no difference between night and day in this place. I do not see\n",
      "how one can calculate the time.'\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without apparent reason,\n",
      "a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent. Winston sat quietly, his\n",
      "hands crossed. Ampleforth, too large to sit in comfort on the narrow\n",
      "bench, fidgeted from side to side, clasping his lank hands first round one\n",
      "knee, then round the other. The telescreen barked at him to keep still.\n",
      "Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour--it was difficult to judge. Once more\n",
      "there was a sound of boots outside. Winston's entrails contracted. Soon,\n",
      "very soon, perhaps in five minutes, perhaps now, the tramp of boots would\n",
      "mean that his own turn had come.\n",
      "\n",

      "perturbed, but uncomprehending.\n",
      "\n",
      "What seemed like a long time passed. The pain in Winston's belly had\n",
      "revived. His mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ball\n",
      "falling again and again into the same series of slots. He had only six\n",
      "thoughts. The pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the\n",
      "screaming; O'Brien; Julia; the razor blade. There was another spasm in his\n",
      "entrails, the heavy boots were approaching. As the door opened, the wave\n",
      "of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat. Parsons\n",
      "walked into the cell. He was wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "'YOU here!' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor\n",
      "surprise, but only misery. He began walking jerkily up and down, evidently\n",
      "unable to keep still. Each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was\n",
      "apparent that they were trembling. His eyes had a wide-open, staring look,\n",
      "as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at something in the\n",
      "middle distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What are you in for?' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thoughtcrime!' said Parsons, almost blubbering. The tone of his voice\n",
      "implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous\n",
      "horror that such a word could be applied to himself. He paused opposite\n",
      "Winston and began eagerly appealing to him: 'You don't think they'll shoot\n",
      "me, do you, old chap? They don't shoot you if you haven't actually done\n",
      "anything--only thoughts, which you can't help? I know they give you a fair\n",
      "hearing. Oh, I trust them for that! They'll know my record, won't they?\n",
      "YOU know what kind of chap I was. Not a bad chap in my way. Not brainy, of\n",
      "course, but keen. I tried to do my best for the Party, didn't I? I'll get\n",
      "off with five years, don't you think? Or even ten years? A chap like me\n",
      "could make himself pretty useful in a labour-camp. They wouldn't shoot me\n",
      "for going off the rails just once?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Are you guilty?' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course I'm guilty!' cried Parsons with a servile glance at the\n",
      "telescreen. 'You don't think the Party would arrest an innocent man,\n",
      "do you?' His frog-like face grew calmer, and even took on a slightly\n",
      "sanctimonious expression. 'Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,'\n",
      "he said sententiously. 'It's insidious. It can get hold of you without\n",
      "your even knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In my sleep! Yes,\n",
      "that's a fact. There I was, working away, trying to do my bit--never knew\n",
      "I had any bad stuff in my mind at all. And then I started talking in my\n",
      "sleep. Do you know what they heard me saying?'\n",
      "\n",
      "He sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to\n",
      "utter an obscenity.\n",
      "\n",
      "'\"Down with Big Brother!\" Yes, I said that! Said it over and over again,\n",
      "it seems. Between you and me, old man, I'm glad they got me before it went\n",
      "any further. Do you know what I'm going to say to them when I go up before\n",
      "the tribunal? \"Thank you,\" I'm going to say, \"thank you for saving me\n",
      "before it was too late.\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who denounced you?' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was my little daughter,' said Parsons with a sort of doleful pride.\n",
      "'She listened at the keyhole. Heard what I was saying, and nipped off to\n",
      "the patrols the very next day. Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?\n",
      "I don't bear her any grudge for it. In fact I'm proud of her. It shows I\n",
      "brought her up in the right spirit, anyway.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He made a few more jerky movements up and down, several times, casting a\n",
      "longing glance at the lavatory pan. Then he suddenly ripped down his\n",
      "shorts.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Excuse me, old man,' he said. 'I can't help it. It's the waiting.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan. Winston covered his\n",
      "face with his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Smith!' yelled the voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W.! Uncover your\n",
      "face. No faces covered in the cells.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston uncovered his face. Parsons used the lavatory, loudly and\n",
      "abundantly. It then turned out that the plug was defective and the cell\n",
      "stank abominably for hours afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parsons was removed. More prisoners came and went, mysteriously. One, a\n",
      "woman, was consigned to 'Room 101', and, Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel\n",
      "and turn a different colour when she heard the words. A time came when, if\n",
      "it had been morning when he was brought here, it would be afternoon; or if\n",
      "it had been afternoon, then it would be midnight. There were six prisoners\n",
      "in the cell, men and women. All sat very still. Opposite Winston there sat\n",
      "a man with a chinless, toothy face exactly like that of some large,\n",
      "harmless rodent. His fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom\n",
      "that it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of food\n",
      "tucked away there. His pale-grey eyes flitted timorously from face to face\n",
      "and turned quickly away again when he caught anyone's eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door opened, and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance sent\n",
      "a momentary chill through Winston. He was a commonplace, mean-looking man\n",
      "who might have been an engineer or technician of some kind. But what was\n",
      "startling was the emaciation of his face. It was like a skull. Because of\n",
      "its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large, and the\n",
      "eyes seemed filled with a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody or\n",
      "something.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man sat down on the bench at a little distance from Winston. Winston\n",
      "did not look at him again, but the tormented, skull-like face was as\n",
      "vivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes.\n",
      "Suddenly he realized what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation.\n",
      "The same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the\n",
      "cell. There was a very faint stirring all the way round the bench. The\n",
      "eyes of the chinless man kept flitting towards the skull-faced man, then\n",
      "turning guiltily away, then being dragged back by an irresistible\n",
      "attraction. Presently he began to fidget on his seat. At last he stood up,\n",
      "waddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket of his overalls,\n",
      "and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece of bread to the\n",
      "skull-faced man.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen. The chinless man\n",
      "jumped in his tracks. The skull-faced man had quickly thrust his hands\n",
      "behind his back, as though demonstrating to all the world that he refused\n",
      "the gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Bumstead!' roared the voice. '2713 Bumstead J.! Let fall that piece of\n",
      "bread!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Remain standing where you are,' said the voice. 'Face the door. Make no\n",
      "movement.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The chinless man obeyed. His large pouchy cheeks were quivering\n",
      "uncontrollably. The door clanged open. As the young officer entered and\n",
      "stepped aside, there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard with\n",
      "enormous arms and shoulders. He took his stand opposite the chinless man,\n",
      "and then, at a signal from the officer, let free a frightful blow, with\n",
      "all the weight of his body behind it, full in the chinless man's mouth.\n",
      "The force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor. His body\n",
      "was flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory\n",
      "seat. For a moment he lay as though stunned, with dark blood oozing from\n",
      "his mouth and nose. A very faint whimpering or squeaking, which seemed\n",
      "unconscious, came out of him. Then he rolled over and raised himself\n",
      "unsteadily on hands and knees. Amid a stream of blood and saliva, the two\n",
      "halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their knees. The\n",
      "chinless man climbed back into his place. Down one side of his face the\n",
      "flesh was darkening. His mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherry-coloured\n",
      "mass with a black hole in the middle of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "From time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls.\n",
      "His grey eyes still flitted from face to face, more guiltily than ever,\n",
      "as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for\n",
      "his humiliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door opened. With a small gesture the officer indicated the\n",
      "skull-faced man.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Room 101,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a gasp and a flurry at Winston's side. The man had actually\n",
      "flung himself on his knees on the floor, with his hand clasped together.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Comrade! Officer!' he cried. 'You don't have to take me to that place!\n",
      "Haven't I told you everything already? What else is it you want to know?\n",
      "There's nothing I wouldn't confess, nothing! Just tell me what it is and\n",
      "I'll confess straight off. Write it down and I'll sign it--anything!\n",
      "Not room 101!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Room 101,' said the officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man's face, already very pale, turned a colour Winston would not have\n",
      "believed possible. It was definitely, unmistakably, a shade of green.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do anything to me!' he yelled. 'You've been starving me for weeks. Finish\n",
      "it off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me. Sentence me to twenty-five\n",
      "years. Is there somebody else you want me to give away? Just say who it is\n",
      "and I'll tell you anything you want. I don't care who it is or what you do\n",
      "to them. I've got a wife and three children. The biggest of them isn't six\n",
      "years old. You can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats in\n",
      "front of my eyes, and I'll stand by and watch it. But not Room 101!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Room 101,' said the officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man looked frantically round at the other prisoners, as though with\n",
      "some idea that he could put another victim in his own place. His eyes\n",
      "settled on the smashed face of the chinless man. He flung out a lean arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's the one you ought to be taking, not me!' he shouted. 'You didn't\n",
      "hear what he was saying after they bashed his face. Give me a chance and\n",
      "I'll tell you every word of it. HE'S the one that's against the Party, not\n",
      "me.' The guards stepped forward. The man's voice rose to a shriek. 'You\n",
      "didn't hear him!' he repeated. 'Something went wrong with the telescreen.\n",
      "HE'S the one you want. Take him, not me!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms. But just at\n",
      "this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed one\n",
      "of the iron legs that supported the bench. He had set up a wordless\n",
      "howling, like an animal. The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose,\n",
      "but he clung on with astonishing strength. For perhaps twenty seconds\n",
      "they were hauling at him. The prisoners sat quiet, their hands crossed on\n",
      "their knees, looking straight in front of them. The howling stopped; the\n",
      "man had no breath left for anything except hanging on. Then there was a\n",
      "different kind of cry. A kick from a guard's boot had broken the fingers\n",
      "of one of his hands. They dragged him to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Room 101,' said the officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head sunken, nursing his\n",
      "crushed hand, all the fight had gone out of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "A long time passed. If it had been midnight when the skull-faced man was\n",
      "taken away, it was morning: if morning, it was afternoon. Winston was\n",
      "alone, and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow\n",
      "bench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the\n",
      "telescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had\n",
      "dropped it. At the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it,\n",
      "but presently hunger gave way to thirst. His mouth was sticky and\n",
      "evil-tasting. The humming sound and the unvarying white light induced a\n",
      "sort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. He would get up\n",
      "because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sit\n",
      "down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of\n",
      "staying on his feet. Whenever his physical sensations were a little under\n",
      "control the terror returned. Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of\n",
      "O'Brien and the razor blade. It was thinkable that the razor blade might\n",
      "arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he thought\n",
      "of Julia. Somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he.\n",
      "She might be screaming with pain at this moment. He thought: 'If I could\n",
      "save Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes, I would.' But that\n",
      "was merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought\n",
      "to take it. He did not feel it. In this place you could not feel anything,\n",
      "except pain and foreknowledge of pain. Besides, was it possible, when you\n",
      "were actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your own pain\n",
      "should increase? But that question was not answerable yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boots were approaching again. The door opened. O'Brien came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven all\n",
      "caution out of him. For the first time in many years he forgot the\n",
      "presence of the telescreen.\n",
      "\n",
      "'They've got you too!' he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'They got me a long time ago,' said O'Brien with a mild, almost regretful\n",
      "irony. He stepped aside. From behind him there emerged a broad-chested\n",
      "guard with a long black truncheon in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You know this, Winston,' said O'Brien. 'Don't deceive yourself. You did\n",
      "know it--you have always known it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was no time to think of\n",
      "that. All he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard's hand. It might\n",
      "fall anywhere; on the crown, on the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on\n",
      "the elbow----\n",
      "\n",
      "The elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost paralysed, clasping the\n",
      "stricken elbow with his other hand. Everything had exploded into yellow\n",
      "light. Inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain!\n",
      "The light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him. The\n",
      "guard was laughing at his contortions. One question at any rate was\n",
      "answered. Never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase\n",
      "of pain. Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop.\n",
      "Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. In the face of pain\n",
      "there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as he writhed\n",
      "on the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except that it was\n",
      "higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he\n",
      "could not move. Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his\n",
      "face. O'Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently. At\n",
      "the other side of him stood a man in a white coat, holding a hypodermic\n",
      "syringe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually.\n",
      "He had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite\n",
      "different world, a sort of underwater world far beneath it. How long he\n",
      "had been down there he did not know. Since the moment when they arrested\n",
      "him he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his memories were not\n",
      "continuous. There had been times when consciousness, even the sort of\n",
      "consciousness that one has in sleep, had stopped dead and started again\n",
      "after a blank interval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeks\n",
      "or only seconds, there was no way of knowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started. Later he was\n",
      "to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary, a routine\n",
      "interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a\n",
      "long range of crimes--espionage, sabotage, and the like--to which everyone\n",
      "had to confess as a matter of course. The confession was a formality,\n",
      "though the torture was real. How many times he had been beaten, how long\n",
      "the beatings had continued, he could not remember. Always there were five\n",
      "or six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. Sometimes it was\n",
      "fists, sometimes it was truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods, sometimes\n",
      "it was boots. There were times when he rolled about the floor, as shameless\n",
      "as an animal, writhing his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless\n",
      "effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet more kicks,\n",
      "in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in his groin,\n",
      "in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine. There were times\n",
      "when it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed\n",
      "to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not\n",
      "force himself into losing consciousness. There were times when his nerve\n",
      "so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating\n",
      "began, when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough\n",
      "to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There\n",
      "were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing\n",
      "nothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of\n",
      "pain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he\n",
      "said to himself: 'I will confess, but not yet. I must hold out till the\n",
      "pain becomes unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I will\n",
      "tell them what they want.' Sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly\n",
      "stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell,\n",
      "left to recuperate for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again.\n",
      "There were also longer periods of recovery. He remembered them dimly,\n",
      "because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor. He remembered a cell\n",
      "with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall, and a tin\n",
      "wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee. He\n",
      "remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair,\n",
      "and businesslike, unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse,\n",
      "tapping his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers over\n",
      "him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles into his arm to make\n",
      "him sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a threat, a horror\n",
      "to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were\n",
      "unsatisfactory. His questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms\n",
      "but Party intellectuals, little rotund men with quick movements and\n",
      "flashing spectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which\n",
      "lasted--he thought, he could not be sure--ten or twelve hours at a stretch.\n",
      "These other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain, but\n",
      "it was not chiefly pain that they relied on. They slapped his face, wrung\n",
      "his ears, pulled his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to\n",
      "urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water;\n",
      "but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of\n",
      "arguing and reasoning. Their real weapon was the merciless questioning\n",
      "that went on and on, hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for\n",
      "him, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every step of\n",
      "lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame as\n",
      "from nervous fatigue. Sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a\n",
      "single session. Most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened\n",
      "at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes\n",
      "they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him in\n",
      "the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even\n",
      "now he had not enough loyalty to the Party left to make him wish to\n",
      "undo the evil he had done. When his nerves were in rags after hours of\n",
      "questioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears. In the\n",
      "end the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots and\n",
      "fists of the guards. He became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that\n",
      "signed, whatever was demanded of him. His sole concern was to find out\n",
      "what they wanted him to confess, and then confess it quickly, before the\n",
      "bullying started anew. He confessed to the assassination of eminent Party\n",
      "members, the distribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of public\n",
      "funds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. He confessed that\n",
      "he had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian government as far back as\n",
      "1968. He confessed that he was a religious believer, an admirer of\n",
      "capitalism, and a sexual pervert. He confessed that he had murdered his\n",
      "wife, although he knew, and his questioners must have known, that his wife\n",
      "was still alive. He confessed that for years he had been in personal touch\n",
      "with Goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which\n",
      "had included almost every human being he had ever known. It was easier to\n",
      "confess everything and implicate everybody. Besides, in a sense it was all\n",
      "true. It was true that he had been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes\n",
      "of the Party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were also memories of another kind. They stood out in his mind\n",
      "disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was in a cell which might have been either dark or light, because he\n",
      "could see nothing except a pair of eyes. Near at hand some kind of\n",
      "instrument was ticking slowly and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more\n",
      "luminous. Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and\n",
      "was swallowed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under dazzling lights.\n",
      "A man in a white coat was reading the dials. There was a tramp of heavy\n",
      "boots outside. The door clanged open. The waxed-faced officer marched in,\n",
      "followed by two guards.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Room 101,' said the officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did not look at Winston\n",
      "either; he was looking only at the dials.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre wide, full of glorious,\n",
      "golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the\n",
      "top of his voice. He was confessing everything, even the things he had\n",
      "succeeded in holding back under the torture. He was relating the entire\n",
      "history of his life to an audience who knew it already. With him were the\n",
      "guards, the other questioners, the men in white coats, O'Brien, Julia,\n",
      "Mr Charrington, all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with\n",
      "laughter. Some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had\n",
      "somehow been skipped over and had not happened. Everything was all right,\n",
      "there was no more pain, the last detail of his life was laid bare,\n",
      "understood, forgiven.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he had\n",
      "heard O'Brien's voice. All through his interrogation, although he had\n",
      "never seen him, he had had the feeling that O'Brien was at his elbow, just\n",
      "out of sight. It was O'Brien who was directing everything. It was he who\n",
      "set the guards on to Winston and who prevented them from killing him. It\n",
      "was he who decided when Winston should scream with pain, when he should\n",
      "have a respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when the\n",
      "drugs should be pumped into his arm. It was he who asked the questions and\n",
      "suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was\n",
      "the inquisitor, he was the friend. And once--Winston could not remember\n",
      "whether it was in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment\n",
      "of wakefulness--a voice murmured in his ear: 'Don't worry, Winston; you\n",
      "are in my keeping. For seven years I have watched over you. Now the\n",
      "turning-point has come. I shall save you, I shall make you perfect.' He\n",
      "was not sure whether it was O'Brien's voice; but it was the same voice\n",
      "that had said to him, 'We shall meet in the place where there is no\n",
      "darkness,' in that other dream, seven years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not remember any ending to his interrogation. There was a period of\n",
      "blackness and then the cell, or room, in which he now was had gradually\n",
      "materialized round him. He was almost flat on his back, and unable to move.\n",
      "His body was held down at every essential point. Even the back of his head\n",
      "was gripped in some manner. O'Brien was looking down at him gravely and\n",
      "rather sadly. His face, seen from below, looked coarse and worn, with\n",
      "pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was older\n",
      "than Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight or fifty. Under\n",
      "his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round\n",
      "the face.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I told you,' said O'Brien, 'that if we met again it would be here.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without any warning except a slight movement of O'Brien's hand, a wave of\n",
      "pain flooded his body. It was a frightening pain, because he could not see\n",
      "what was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was\n",
      "being done to him. He did not know whether the thing was really happening,\n",
      "or whether the effect was electrically produced; but his body was being\n",
      "wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart. Although\n",
      "the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was\n",
      "the fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set his teeth and\n",
      "breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as long as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are afraid,' said O'Brien, watching his face, 'that in another moment\n",
      "something is going to break. Your especial fear is that it will be your\n",
      "backbone. You have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart\n",
      "and the spinal fluid dripping out of them. That is what you are thinking,\n",
      "is it not, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston did not answer. O'Brien drew back the lever on the dial. The wave\n",
      "of pain receded almost as quickly as it had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That was forty,' said O'Brien. 'You can see that the numbers on this dial\n",
      "run up to a hundred. Will you please remember, throughout our conversation,\n",
      "that I have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to\n",
      "whatever degree I choose? If you tell me any lies, or attempt to\n",
      "prevaricate in any way, or even fall below your usual level of\n",
      "intelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly. Do you understand\n",
      "that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien's manner became less severe. He resettled his spectacles\n",
      "thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and down. When he spoke his voice\n",
      "was gentle and patient. He had the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a\n",
      "priest, anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am taking trouble with you, Winston,' he said, 'because you are worth\n",
      "trouble. You know perfectly well what is the matter with you. You have\n",
      "known it for years, though you have fought against the knowledge. You are\n",
      "mentally deranged. You suffer from a defective memory. You are unable to\n",
      "remember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember other\n",
      "events which never happened. Fortunately it is curable. You have never\n",
      "cured yourself of it, because you did not choose to. There was a small\n",
      "effort of the will that you were not ready to make. Even now, I am well\n",
      "aware, you are clinging to your disease under the impression that it is\n",
      "a virtue. Now we will take an example. At this moment, which power is\n",
      "Oceania at war with?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'With Eastasia. Good. And Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia,\n",
      "has it not?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth to speak and then did not\n",
      "speak. He could not take his eyes away from the dial.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The truth, please, Winston. YOUR truth. Tell me what you think you\n",
      "remember.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I remember that until only a week before I was arrested, we were not at\n",
      "war with Eastasia at all. We were in alliance with them. The war was\n",
      "against Eurasia. That had lasted for four years. Before that----'\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Another example,' he said. 'Some years ago you had a very serious delusion\n",
      "indeed. You believed that three men, three one-time Party members named\n",
      "Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford--men who were executed for treachery and\n",
      "sabotage after making the fullest possible confession--were not guilty of\n",
      "the crimes they were charged with. You believed that you had seen\n",
      "unmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions were\n",
      "false. There was a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination.\n",
      "You believed that you had actually held it in your hands. It was a\n",
      "photograph something like this.'\n",
      "\n",
      "An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O'Brien's fingers. For\n",
      "perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of Winston's vision. It was\n",
      "a photograph, and there was no question of its identity. It was THE\n",
      "photograph. It was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, and\n",
      "Rutherford at the party function in New York, which he had chanced upon\n",
      "eleven years ago and promptly destroyed. For only an instant it was before\n",
      "his eyes, then it was out of sight again. But he had seen it,\n",
      "unquestionably he had seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort to\n",
      "wrench the top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so much as\n",
      "a centimetre in any direction. For the moment he had even forgotten the\n",
      "dial. All he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again, or at\n",
      "least to see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It exists!' he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No,' said O'Brien.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stepped across the room. There was a memory hole in the opposite wall.\n",
      "O'Brien lifted the grating. Unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirling\n",
      "away on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame.\n",
      "O'Brien turned away from the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ashes,' he said. 'Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It does not exist.\n",
      "It never existed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I remember it.\n",
      "You remember it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I do not remember it,' said O'Brien.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston's heart sank. That was doublethink. He had a feeling of deadly\n",
      "helplessness. If he could have been certain that O'Brien was lying, it\n",
      "would not have seemed to matter. But it was perfectly possible that O'Brien\n",
      "had really forgotten the photograph. And if so, then already he would have\n",
      "forgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act of\n",
      "forgetting. How could one be sure that it was simple trickery? Perhaps\n",
      "that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was the\n",
      "thought that defeated him.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien was looking down at him speculatively. More than ever he had the\n",
      "air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There is a Party slogan dealing with the control of the past,' he said.\n",
      "'Repeat it, if you please.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'\"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present\n",
      "controls the past,\"' repeated Winston obediently.\n",
      "\n",
      "'\"Who controls the present controls the past,\"' said O'Brien, nodding his\n",
      "head with slow approval. 'Is it your opinion, Winston, that the past has\n",
      "real existence?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the feeling of helplessness descended upon Winston. His eyes flitted\n",
      "towards the dial. He not only did not know whether 'yes' or 'no' was the\n",
      "answer that would save him from pain; he did not even know which answer he\n",
      "believed to be the true one.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien smiled faintly. 'You are no metaphysician, Winston,' he said.\n",
      "'Until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence. I\n",
      "will put it more precisely. Does the past exist concretely, in space? Is\n",
      "there somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past\n",
      "is still happening?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then where does the past exist, if at all?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In records. It is written down.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In records. And----?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In the mind. In human memories.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control all records, and we\n",
      "control all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But how can you stop people remembering things?' cried Winston again\n",
      "momentarily forgetting the dial. 'It is involuntary. It is outside oneself.\n",
      "How can you control memory? You have not controlled mine!'\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien's manner grew stern again. He laid his hand on the dial.\n",
      "\n",
      "'On the contrary,' he said, 'YOU have not controlled it. That is what has\n",
      "brought you here. You are here because you have failed in humility, in\n",
      "self-discipline. You would not make the act of submission which is the\n",
      "price of sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Only the\n",
      "disciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believe that reality is\n",
      "something objective, external, existing in its own right. You also believe\n",
      "that the nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude yourself into\n",
      "thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the\n",
      "same thing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external.\n",
      "Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual\n",
      "mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the\n",
      "mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party\n",
      "holds to be the truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality except by\n",
      "looking through the eyes of the Party. That is the fact that you have got\n",
      "to relearn, Winston. It needs an act of self-destruction, an effort of the\n",
      "will. You must humble yourself before you can become sane.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused for a few moments, as though to allow what he had been saying to\n",
      "sink in.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you remember,' he went on, 'writing in your diary, \"Freedom is the\n",
      "freedom to say that two plus two make four\"?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston, with the thumb\n",
      "hidden and the four fingers extended.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Four.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And if the party says that it is not four but five--then how many?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Four.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The word ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dial had shot up to\n",
      "fifty-five. The sweat had sprung out all over Winston's body. The air tore\n",
      "into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his\n",
      "teeth he could not stop. O'Brien watched him, the four fingers still\n",
      "extended. He drew back the lever. This time the pain was only slightly\n",
      "eased.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How many fingers, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Four.'\n",

      "\n",
      "'Four! Four! What else can I say? Four!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The needle must have risen again, but he did not look at it. The heavy,\n",
      "stern face and the four fingers filled his vision. The fingers stood up\n",
      "before his eyes like pillars, enormous, blurry, and seeming to vibrate,\n",
      "but unmistakably four.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How many fingers, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Four! Stop it, stop it! How can you go on? Four! Four!'\n",

      "'Four! five! Four! Anything you like. Only stop it, stop the pain!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Abruptly he was sitting up with O'Brien's arm round his shoulders. He had\n",
      "perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds. The bonds that had held his\n",
      "body down were loosened. He felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably,\n",
      "his teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. For a\n",
      "moment he clung to O'Brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavy\n",
      "arm round his shoulders. He had the feeling that O'Brien was his protector,\n",
      "that the pain was something that came from outside, from some other source,\n",
      "and that it was O'Brien who would save him from it.\n",
      "\n",

      "'Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three.\n",

      "easy to become sane.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He laid Winston down on the bed. The grip of his limbs tightened again,\n",
      "but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped, leaving him\n",
      "merely weak and cold. O'Brien motioned with his head to the man in the\n",
      "white coat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings. The man in\n",
      "the white coat bent down and looked closely into Winston's eyes, felt his\n",
      "pulse, laid an ear against his chest, tapped here and there, then he\n",

      "\n",
      "'Again,' said O'Brien.\n",
      "\n",

      "seventy-five. He had shut his eyes this time. He knew that the fingers\n",
      "were still there, and still four. All that mattered was somehow to stay\n",
      "alive until the spasm was over. He had ceased to notice whether he was\n",
      "crying out or not. The pain lessened again. He opened his eyes. O'Brien\n",
      "had drawn back the lever.\n",
      "\n",

      "Perhaps the needle was eighty--ninety. Winston could not intermittently\n",
      "remember why the pain was happening. Behind his screwed-up eyelids a\n",
      "forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and\n",
      "out, disappearing behind one another and reappearing again. He was trying\n",
      "to count them, he could not remember why. He knew only that it was\n",
      "impossible to count them, and that this was somehow due to the mysterious\n",
      "identity between five and four. The pain died down again. When he opened\n",
      "his eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thing.\n",
      "Innumerable fingers, like moving trees, were still streaming past in\n",
      "either direction, crossing and recrossing. He shut his eyes again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know. I don't know. You will kill me if you do that again. Four,\n",
      "five, six--in all honesty I don't know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Better,' said O'Brien.\n",
      "\n",
      "A needle slid into Winston's arm. Almost in the same instant a blissful,\n",
      "healing warmth spread all through his body. The pain was already\n",
      "half-forgotten. He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O'Brien.\n",
      "At sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart\n",
      "seemed to turn over. If he could have moved he would have stretched out\n",
      "a hand and laid it on O'Brien's arm. He had never loved him so deeply as\n",
      "at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the pain. The old\n",
      "feeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether O'Brien was a friend\n",
      "or an enemy, had come back. O'Brien was a person who could be talked to.\n",
      "Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. O'Brien\n",
      "had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was\n",
      "certain, he would send him to his death. It made no difference. In some\n",
      "sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere or\n",
      "other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place\n",
      "where they could meet and talk. O'Brien was looking down at him with an\n",
      "expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind.\n",
      "When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you know where you are, Winston?' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you know how long you have been here?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know. Days, weeks, months--I think it is months.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And why do you imagine that we bring people to this place?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'To make them confess.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, that is not the reason. Try again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'To punish them.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No!' exclaimed O'Brien. His voice had changed extraordinarily, and his\n",
      "face had suddenly become both stern and animated. 'No! Not merely to\n",
      "extract your confession, not to punish you. Shall I tell you why we have\n",
      "brought you here? To cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand,\n",
      "Winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands\n",
      "uncured? We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have\n",
      "committed. The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is\n",
      "all we care about. We do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them.\n",
      "Do you understand what I mean by that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "He was bending over Winston. His face looked enormous because of its\n",
      "nearness, and hideously ugly because it was seen from below. Moreover it\n",
      "was filled with a sort of exaltation, a lunatic intensity. Again Winston's\n",
      "heart shrank. If it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into\n",
      "the bed. He felt certain that O'Brien was about to twist the dial out of\n",
      "sheer wantonness. At this moment, however, O'Brien turned away. He took a\n",
      "pace or two up and down. Then he continued less vehemently:\n",
      "\n",
      "'The first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no\n",
      "martyrdoms. You have read of the religious persecutions of the past. In\n",
      "the Middle Ages there was the Inquisition. It was a failure. It set out\n",
      "to eradicate heresy, and ended by perpetuating it. For every heretic it\n",
      "burned at the stake, thousands of others rose up. Why was that? Because\n",
      "the Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them while\n",
      "they were still unrepentant: in fact, it killed them because they were\n",
      "unrepentant. Men were dying because they would not abandon their true\n",
      "beliefs. Naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame\n",
      "to the Inquisitor who burned him. Later, in the twentieth century, there\n",
      "were the totalitarians, as they were called. There were the German Nazis\n",
      "and the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted heresy more cruelly\n",
      "than the Inquisition had done. And they imagined that they had learned\n",
      "from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must not\n",
      "make martyrs. Before they exposed their victims to public trial, they\n",
      "deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity. They wore them down\n",
      "by torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches,\n",
      "confessing whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves with\n",
      "abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy.\n",
      "And yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again.\n",
      "The dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. Once\n",
      "again, why was it? In the first place, because the confessions that they\n",
      "had made were obviously extorted and untrue. We do not make mistakes of\n",
      "that kind. All the confessions that are uttered here are true. We make\n",
      "them true. And above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us.\n",
      "You must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, Winston.\n",
      "Posterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted clean out from the\n",
      "stream of history. We shall turn you into gas and pour you into the\n",
      "stratosphere. Nothing will remain of you, not a name in a register, not\n",
      "a memory in a living brain. You will be annihilated in the past as well\n",
      "as in the future. You will never have existed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with a momentary\n",
      "bitterness. O'Brien checked his step as though Winston had uttered the\n",
      "thought aloud. His large ugly face came nearer, with the eyes a little\n",
      "narrowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are thinking,' he said, 'that since we intend to destroy you utterly,\n",
      "so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest difference--in\n",
      "that case, why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first? That is\n",
      "what you were thinking, was it not?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien smiled slightly. 'You are a flaw in the pattern, Winston. You are\n",
      "a stain that must be wiped out. Did I not tell you just now that we are\n",
      "different from the persecutors of the past? We are not content with\n",
      "negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission. When finally\n",
      "you surrender to us, it must be of your own free will. We do not destroy\n",
      "the heretic because he resists us: so long as he resists us we never\n",
      "destroy him. We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him.\n",
      "We burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to our\n",
      "side, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him one of\n",
      "ourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable to us that an erroneous\n",
      "thought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless\n",
      "it may be. Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation. In\n",
      "the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming\n",
      "his heresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purges could\n",
      "carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage\n",
      "waiting for the bullet. But we make the brain perfect before we blow it\n",
      "out. The command of the old despotisms was \"Thou shalt not\". The command\n",
      "of the totalitarians was \"Thou shalt\". Our command is \"THOU ART\". No one\n",
      "whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. Everyone is washed\n",
      "clean. Even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once\n",
      "believed--Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford--in the end we broke them down.\n",
      "I took part in their interrogation myself. I saw them gradually worn down,\n",
      "whimpering, grovelling, weeping--and in the end it was not with pain or\n",
      "fear, only with penitence. By the time we had finished with them they were\n",
      "only the shells of men. There was nothing left in them except sorrow for\n",
      "what they had done, and love of Big Brother. It was touching to see\n",
      "how they loved him. They begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die\n",
      "while their minds were still clean.'\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice had grown almost dreamy. The exaltation, the lunatic enthusiasm,\n",
      "was still in his face. He is not pretending, thought Winston, he is not a\n",
      "hypocrite, he believes every word he says. What most oppressed him was the\n",
      "consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. He watched the heavy\n",
      "yet graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out of the range of his\n",
      "vision. O'Brien was a being in all ways larger than himself. There was no\n",
      "idea that he had ever had, or could have, that O'Brien had not long ago\n",
      "known, examined, and rejected. His mind CONTAINED Winston's mind. But\n",
      "in that case how could it be true that O'Brien was mad? It must be he,\n",
      "Winston, who was mad. O'Brien halted and looked down at him. His voice had\n",
      "grown stern again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do not imagine that you will save yourself, Winston, however completely\n",
      "you surrender to us. No one who has once gone astray is ever spared. And\n",
      "even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life, still\n",
      "you would never escape from us. What happens to you here is for ever.\n",
      "Understand that in advance. We shall crush you down to the point from\n",
      "which there is no coming back. Things will happen to you from which you\n",
      "could not recover, if you lived a thousand years. Never again will you be\n",
      "capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you.\n",
      "Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living,\n",
      "or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow.\n",
      "We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused and signed to the man in the white coat. Winston was aware of\n",
      "some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head.\n",
      "O'Brien had sat down beside the bed, so that his face was almost on a\n",
      "level with Winston's.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Three thousand,' he said, speaking over Winston's head to the man in the\n",
      "white coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two soft pads, which felt slightly moist, clamped themselves against\n",
      "Winston's temples. He quailed. There was pain coming, a new kind of pain.\n",
      "O'Brien laid a hand reassuringly, almost kindly, on his.\n",
      "\n",
      "'This time it will not hurt,' he said. 'Keep your eyes fixed on mine.'\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment there was a devastating explosion, or what seemed like an\n",
      "explosion, though it was not certain whether there was any noise. There\n",
      "was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light. Winston was not hurt, only\n",
      "prostrated. Although he had already been lying on his back when the thing\n",
      "happened, he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that\n",
      "position. A terrific painless blow had flattened him out. Also something\n",
      "had happened inside his head. As his eyes regained their focus he\n",
      "remembered who he was, and where he was, and recognized the face that was\n",
      "gazing into his own; but somewhere or other there was a large patch of\n",
      "emptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of his brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It will not last,' said O'Brien. 'Look me in the eyes. What country is\n",
      "Oceania at war with?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston thought. He knew what was meant by Oceania and that he himself was\n",
      "a citizen of Oceania. He also remembered Eurasia and Eastasia; but who was\n",
      "at war with whom he did not know. In fact he had not been aware that there\n",
      "was any war.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't remember.'\n",

      "life, since the beginning of the Party, since the beginning of history,\n",
      "the war has continued without a break, always the same war. Do you\n",
      "remember that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had been\n",
      "condemned to death for treachery. You pretended that you had seen a piece\n",
      "of paper which proved them innocent. No such piece of paper ever existed.\n",
      "You invented it, and later you grew to believe in it. You remember now the\n",
      "very moment at which you first invented it. Do you remember that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes.'\n",

      "everything was normal again, and the old fear, the hatred, and the\n",
      "bewilderment came crowding back again. But there had been a moment--he did\n",
      "not know how long, thirty seconds, perhaps--of luminous certainty, when\n",
      "each new suggestion of O'Brien's had filled up a patch of emptiness and\n",
      "become absolute truth, and when two and two could have been three as\n",
      "easily as five, if that were what was needed. It had faded but before\n",
      "O'Brien had dropped his hand; but though he could not recapture it, he\n",
      "could remember it, as one remembers a vivid experience at some period of\n",
      "one's life when one was in effect a different person.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien stood up with a satisfied air. Over to his left Winston saw the\n",
      "man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a\n",
      "syringe. O'Brien turned to Winston with a smile. In almost the old manner\n",
      "he resettled his spectacles on his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you remember writing in your diary,' he said, 'that it did not matter\n",
      "whether I was a friend or an enemy, since I was at least a person who\n",
      "understood you and could be talked to? You were right. I enjoy talking to\n",
      "you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you\n",
      "happen to be insane. Before we bring the session to an end you can ask me\n",
      "a few questions, if you choose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Any question I like?'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'What have you done with Julia?' said Winston.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien smiled again. 'She betrayed you, Winston. Immediately--unreservedly.\n",
      "I have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly. You would hardly\n",
      "recognize her if you saw her. All her rebelliousness, her deceit, her\n",
      "folly, her dirty-mindedness--everything has been burned out of her. It was\n",

      "\n",
      "'You do not exist,' said O'Brien.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. He knew, or he could\n",
      "imagine, the arguments which proved his own nonexistence; but they were\n",
      "nonsense, they were only a play on words. Did not the statement, 'You do\n",
      "not exist', contain a logical absurdity? But what use was it to say so?\n",
      "His mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable, mad arguments with\n",
      "which O'Brien would demolish him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I think I exist,' he said wearily. 'I am conscious of my own identity.\n",
      "I was born and I shall die. I have arms and legs. I occupy a particular\n",

      "as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston lay silent. His breast rose and fell a little faster. He still had\n",
      "not asked the question that had come into his mind the first. He had got\n",
      "to ask it, and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it. There\n",
      "was a trace of amusement in O'Brien's face. Even his spectacles seemed to\n",
      "wear an ironical gleam. He knows, thought Winston suddenly, he knows what\n",
      "I am going to ask! At the thought the words burst out of him:\n",
      "\n",
      "'What is in Room 101?'\n",
      "\n",

      "Room 101.'\n",

      "\n",
      "As always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of late his bonds were\n",
      "looser. They still held him to the bed, but he could move his knees a\n",
      "little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from\n",
      "the elbow. The dial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. He could\n",
      "evade its pangs if he was quick-witted enough: it was chiefly when he\n",
      "showed stupidity that O'Brien pulled the lever. Sometimes they got through\n",
      "a whole session without use of the dial. He could not remember how many\n",

      "the same question. You could grasp the mechanics of the Society you lived\n",
      "in, but not its underlying motives. Do you remember writing in your diary,\n",
      "\"I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY\"? It was when you thought about\n",
      "\"why\" that you doubted your own sanity. You have read THE BOOK,\n",

      "He came closer to the bed. 'For ever!' he repeated. 'And now let us get\n",
      "back to the question of \"how\" and \"why\". You understand well enough HOW\n",
      "the Party maintains itself in power. Now tell me WHY we cling to power.\n",
      "What is our motive? Why should we want power? Go on, speak,' he added as\n",
      "Winston remained silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two. A feeling of\n",
      "weariness had overwhelmed him. The faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had come\n",
      "back into O'Brien's face. He knew in advance what O'Brien would say. That\n",
      "the Party did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good of\n",
      "the majority. That it sought power because men in the mass were frail,\n",
      "cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, and\n",
      "must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger\n",
      "than themselves. That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and\n",
      "happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better.\n",
      "That the party was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect\n",
      "doing evil that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of\n",
      "others. The terrible thing, thought Winston, the terrible thing was that\n",
      "when O'Brien said this he would believe it. You could see it in his face.\n",
      "O'Brien knew everything. A thousand times better than Winston he knew what\n",
      "the world was really like, in what degradation the mass of human beings\n",
      "lived and by what lies and barbarities the Party kept them there. He had\n",
      "understood it all, weighed it all, and it made no difference: all was\n",
      "justified by the ultimate purpose. What can you do, thought Winston,\n",
      "against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your\n",
      "arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are ruling over us for our own good,' he said feebly. 'You believe\n",
      "that human beings are not fit to govern themselves, and therefore----'\n",
      "\n",
      "He started and almost cried out. A pang of pain had shot through his body.\n",
      "O'Brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-five.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That was stupid, Winston, stupid!' he said. 'You should know better than\n",
      "to say a thing like that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He pulled the lever back and continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party\n",
      "seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good\n",
      "of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long\n",
      "life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will\n",
      "understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the\n",
      "past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who\n",
      "resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the\n",
      "Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never\n",
      "had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps\n",
      "they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a\n",
      "limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where\n",
      "human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that\n",
      "no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is\n",
      "not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order\n",
      "to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish\n",
      "the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of\n",
      "torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to\n",
      "understand me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston was struck, as he had been struck before, by the tiredness of\n",
      "O'Brien's face. It was strong and fleshy and brutal, it was full of\n",
      "intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself\n",
      "helpless; but it was tired. There were pouches under the eyes, the skin\n",
      "sagged from the cheekbones. O'Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing\n",
      "the worn face nearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You are thinking,' he said, 'that my face is old and tired. You are\n",
      "thinking that I talk of power, and yet I am not even able to prevent the\n",
      "decay of my own body. Can you not understand, Winston, that the individual\n",
      "is only a cell? The weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism.\n",
      "Do you die when you cut your fingernails?'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'We are the priests of power,' he said. 'God is power. But at present\n",
      "power is only a word so far as you are concerned. It is time for you to\n",
      "gather some idea of what power means. The first thing you must realize\n",
      "is that power is collective. The individual only has power in so far as\n",
      "he ceases to be an individual. You know the Party slogan: \"Freedom is\n",
      "Slavery\". Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? Slavery is\n",
      "freedom. Alone--free--the human being is always defeated. It must be so,\n",
      "because every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of all\n",
      "failures. But if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escape\n",
      "from his identity, if he can merge himself in the Party so that he IS the\n",
      "Party, then he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing for you to\n",
      "realize is that power is power over human beings. Over the body--but, above\n",
      "all, over the mind. Power over matter--external reality, as you would call\n",
      "it--is not important. Already our control over matter is absolute.'\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment Winston ignored the dial. He made a violent effort to raise\n",
      "himself into a sitting position, and merely succeeded in wrenching his\n",
      "body painfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "'But how can you control matter?' he burst out. 'You don't even control\n",
      "the climate or the law of gravity. And there are disease, pain, death----'\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien silenced him by a movement of his hand. 'We control matter because\n",
      "we control the mind. Reality is inside the skull. You will learn by\n",

      "levitation--anything. I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if\n",
      "I wish to. I do not wish to, because the Party does not wish it. You must\n",

      "\n",
      "'What are the stars?' said O'Brien indifferently. 'They are bits of fire\n",
      "a few kilometres away. We could reach them if we wanted to. Or we could\n",
      "blot them out. The earth is the centre of the universe. The sun and the\n",
      "stars go round it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston made another convulsive movement. This time he did not say\n",

      "\n",
      "'For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. When we navigate the\n",
      "ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often find it convenient to\n",
      "assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions\n",
      "upon millions of kilometres away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is\n",
      "beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars can be near\n",
      "or distant, according as we need them. Do you suppose our mathematicians\n",
      "are unequal to that? Have you forgotten doublethink?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever he said, the swift answer\n",
      "crushed him like a bludgeon. And yet he knew, he KNEW, that he was in the\n",
      "right. The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind--surely there\n",
      "must be some way of demonstrating that it was false? Had it not been\n",
      "exposed long ago as a fallacy? There was even a name for it, which he\n",
      "had forgotten. A faint smile twitched the corners of O'Brien's mouth as\n",
      "he looked down at him.\n",
      "\n",

      "mistaken. This is not solipsism. Collective solipsism, if you like. But\n",
      "that is a different thing: in fact, the opposite thing. All this is a\n",
      "digression,' he added in a different tone. 'The real power, the power we\n",
      "have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men.'\n",
      "He paused, and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster\n",
      "questioning a promising pupil: 'How does one man assert his power over\n",
      "another, Winston?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston thought. 'By making him suffer,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is\n",
      "suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his\n",
      "own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing\n",
      "human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of\n",
      "your own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are\n",
      "creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that\n",
      "the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery and torment, a\n",
      "world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not\n",
      "less but MORE merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will\n",
      "be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they\n",
      "were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world\n",
      "there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement.\n",
      "Everything else we shall destroy--everything. Already we are breaking down\n",
      "the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We\n",
      "have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and\n",
      "between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend\n",
      "any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends.\n",
      "Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from\n",
      "a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual\n",
      "formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm.\n",
      "Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except\n",
      "loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of\n",
      "Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over\n",
      "a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When\n",
      "we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be\n",
      "no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity,\n",
      "no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be\n",
      "destroyed. But always--do not forget this, Winston--always there will be\n",
      "the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing\n",
      "subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory,\n",
      "the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a\n",
      "picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--for ever.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused as though he expected Winston to speak. Winston had tried to\n",
      "shrink back into the surface of the bed again. He could not say anything.\n",
      "His heart seemed to be frozen. O'Brien went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "'And remember that it is for ever. The face will always be there to be\n",
      "stamped upon. The heretic, the enemy of society, will always be there, so\n",
      "that he can be defeated and humiliated over again. Everything that you\n",
      "have undergone since you have been in our hands--all that will continue,\n",
      "and worse. The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, the\n",
      "executions, the disappearances will never cease. It will be a world of\n",
      "terror as much as a world of triumph. The more the Party is powerful, the\n",
      "less it will be tolerant: the weaker the opposition, the tighter the\n",
      "despotism. Goldstein and his heresies will live for ever. Every day, at\n",
      "every moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat upon and\n",
      "yet they will always survive. This drama that I have played out with you\n",
      "during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after\n",
      "generation, always in subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here\n",
      "at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible--and in the end\n",

      "one time. Beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish\n",
      "rags, just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. As he slid\n",
      "them to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided mirror at the far\n",

      "skeleton-like thing was coming towards him. Its actual appearance was\n",
      "frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. He\n",
      "moved closer to the glass. The creature's face seemed to be protruded,\n",
      "because of its bent carriage. A forlorn, jailbird's face with a nobby\n",
      "forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and\n",
      "battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful.\n",
      "The cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look. Certainly it was\n",
      "his own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had\n",
      "changed inside. The emotions it registered would be different from the\n",
      "ones he felt. He had gone partially bald. For the first moment he had\n",
      "thought that he had gone grey as well, but it was only the scalp that was\n",
      "grey. Except for his hands and a circle of his face, his body was grey all\n",
      "over with ancient, ingrained dirt. Here and there under the dirt there\n",
      "were the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an\n",
      "inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. But the truly frightening\n",
      "thing was the emaciation of his body. The barrel of the ribs was as narrow\n",
      "as that of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker\n",
      "than the thighs. He saw now what O'Brien had meant about seeing the side\n",
      "view. The curvature of the spine was astonishing. The thin shoulders were\n",
      "hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neck\n",
      "seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull. At a guess he\n",

      "By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still felt no\n",

      "growing rounder and his skin tauter. Finally it was established beyond a\n",
      "doubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs were now definitely thicker\n",
      "than his knees. After that, reluctantly at first, he began exercising\n",
      "himself regularly. In a little while he could walk three kilometres,\n",
      "measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders were growing\n",
      "straighter. He attempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished and\n",
      "humiliated to find what things he could not do. He could not move out of a\n",
      "walk, he could not hold his stool out at arm's length, he could not stand\n",
      "on one leg without falling over. He squatted down on his heels, and found\n",
      "that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to\n",
      "a standing position. He lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight\n",
      "by his hands. It was hopeless, he could not raise himself a centimetre.\n",

      "telescreen told them what to do--he had grasped the frivolity, the\n",
      "shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the\n",

      "like a beetle under a magnifying glass. There was no physical act, no word\n",
      "spoken aloud, that they had not noticed, no train of thought that they had\n",
      "not been able to infer. Even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his\n",

      "next, but for the moment he could not recall it. When he did recall it,\n",
      "it was only by consciously reasoning out what it must be: it did not come\n",

      "they were charged with. He had never seen the photograph that disproved\n",
      "their guilt. It had never existed, he had invented it. He remembered\n",
      "remembering contrary things, but those were false memories, products of\n",
      "self-deception. How easy it all was! Only surrender, and everything else\n",
      "followed. It was like swimming against a current that swept you backwards\n",
      "however hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding to turn round and\n",
      "go with the current instead of opposing it. Nothing had changed except\n",

      "breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: 'It doesn't\n",

      "understanding the arguments that contradicted them. It was not easy.\n",
      "It needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation. The arithmetical\n",

      "He obeyed the Party, but he still hated the Party. In the old days he had\n",
      "hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity. Now he had\n",
      "retreated a step further: in the mind he had surrendered, but he had hoped\n",
      "to keep the inner heart inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong, but\n",
      "he preferred to be in the wrong. They would understand that--O'Brien would\n",
      "understand it. It was all confessed in that single foolish cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would have to start all over again. It might take years. He ran a hand\n",
      "over his face, trying to familiarize himself with the new shape. There\n",
      "were deep furrows in the cheeks, the cheekbones felt sharp, the nose\n",
      "flattened. Besides, since last seeing himself in the glass he had been\n",
      "given a complete new set of teeth. It was not easy to preserve\n",
      "inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like. In any\n",
      "case, mere control of the features was not enough. For the first time he\n",
      "perceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from\n",
      "yourself. You must know all the while that it is there, but until it is\n",
      "needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape\n",
      "that could be given a name. From now onwards he must not only think right;\n",
      "he must feel right, dream right. And all the while he must keep his hatred\n",
      "locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and\n",
      "yet unconnected with the rest of him, a kind of cyst.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day they would decide to shoot him. You could not tell when it would\n",
      "happen, but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess. It\n",
      "was always from behind, walking down a corridor. Ten seconds would be\n",
      "enough. In that time the world inside him could turn over. And then\n",
      "suddenly, without a word uttered, without a check in his step, without the\n",
      "changing of a line in his face--suddenly the camouflage would be down and\n",
      "bang! would go the batteries of his hatred. Hatred would fill him like an\n",
      "enormous roaring flame. And almost in the same instant bang! would go the\n",
      "bullet, too late, or too early. They would have blown his brain to pieces\n",
      "before they could reclaim it. The heretical thought would be unpunished,\n",
      "unrepented, out of their reach for ever. They would have blown a hole in\n",
      "their own perfection. To die hating them, that was freedom.\n",

      "He shut his eyes. It was more difficult than accepting an intellectual\n",
      "discipline. It was a question of degrading himself, mutilating himself. He\n",
      "had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth. What was the most horrible,\n",
      "sickening thing of all? He thought of Big Brother. The enormous face\n",

      "At each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed to know,\n",
      "whereabouts he was in the windowless building. Possibly there were slight\n",
      "differences in the air pressure. The cells where the guards had beaten him\n",
      "were below ground level. The room where he had been interrogated by\n",
      "O'Brien was high up near the roof. This place was many metres underground,\n",
      "as deep down as it was possible to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. But he hardly noticed\n",
      "his surroundings. All he noticed was that there were two small tables\n",
      "straight in front of him, each covered with green baize. One was only a\n",
      "metre or two from him, the other was further away, near the door. He was\n",
      "strapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, not\n",
      "even his head. A sort of pad gripped his head from behind, forcing him to\n",
      "look straight in front of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment he was alone, then the door opened and O'Brien came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You asked me once,' said O'Brien, 'what was in Room 101. I told you that\n",
      "you knew the answer already. Everyone knows it. The thing that is in\n",
      "Room 101 is the worst thing in the world.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The door opened again. A guard came in, carrying something made of wire,\n",
      "a box or basket of some kind. He set it down on the further table. Because\n",
      "of the position in which O'Brien was standing. Winston could not see what\n",
      "the thing was.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The worst thing in the world,' said O'Brien, 'varies from individual to\n",
      "individual. It may be burial alive, or death by fire, or by drowning, or\n",
      "by impalement, or fifty other deaths. There are cases where it is some\n",
      "quite trivial thing, not even fatal.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had a better view of\n",
      "the thing on the table. It was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top\n",
      "for carrying it by. Fixed to the front of it was something that looked\n",
      "like a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards. Although it was three\n",
      "or four metres away from him, he could see that the cage was divided\n",
      "lengthways into two compartments, and that there was some kind of creature\n",
      "in each. They were rats.\n",
      "\n",
      "'In your case,' said O'Brien, 'the worst thing in the world happens to be\n",
      "rats.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain what, had\n",
      "passed through Winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage.\n",
      "But at this moment the meaning of the mask-like attachment in front of it\n",
      "suddenly sank into him. His bowels seemed to turn to water.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You can't do that!' he cried out in a high cracked voice. 'You couldn't,\n",
      "you couldn't! It's impossible.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you remember,' said O'Brien, 'the moment of panic that used to occur\n",
      "in your dreams? There was a wall of blackness in front of you, and a\n",
      "roaring sound in your ears. There was something terrible on the other side\n",
      "of the wall. You knew that you knew what it was, but you dared not drag it\n",
      "into the open. It was the rats that were on the other side of the wall.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'O'Brien!' said Winston, making an effort to control his voice. 'You know\n",
      "this is not necessary. What is it that you want me to do?'\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien made no direct answer. When he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish\n",
      "manner that he sometimes affected. He looked thoughtfully into the\n",
      "distance, as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind\n",
      "Winston's back.\n",
      "\n",
      "'By itself,' he said, 'pain is not always enough. There are occasions when\n",
      "a human being will stand out against pain, even to the point of death.\n",
      "But for everyone there is something unendurable--something that cannot be\n",
      "contemplated. Courage and cowardice are not involved. If you are falling\n",
      "from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. If you have come up\n",
      "from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air. It is\n",
      "merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed. It is the same with the\n",
      "rats. For you, they are unendurable. They are a form of pressure that you\n",
      "cannot withstand, even if you wished to. You will do what is required of\n",
      "you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But what is it, what is it? How can I do it if I don't know what it is?'\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table.\n",
      "He set it down carefully on the baize cloth. Winston could hear the blood\n",
      "singing in his ears. He had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness.\n",
      "He was in the middle of a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with\n",
      "sunlight, across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances.\n",
      "Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him. They were\n",
      "enormous rats. They were at the age when a rat's muzzle grows blunt and\n",
      "fierce and his fur brown instead of grey.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The rat,' said O'Brien, still addressing his invisible audience,\n",
      "'although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are aware of that. You will have\n",
      "heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town. In some\n",
      "streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house, even for five\n",
      "minutes. The rats are certain to attack it. Within quite a small time they\n",
      "will strip it to the bones. They also attack sick or dying people. They\n",
      "show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It seemed to reach Winston\n",
      "from far away. The rats were fighting; they were trying to get at each\n",
      "other through the partition. He heard also a deep groan of despair.\n",
      "That, too, seemed to come from outside himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so, pressed something in it.\n",
      "There was a sharp click. Winston made a frantic effort to tear himself\n",
      "loose from the chair. It was hopeless; every part of him, even his head,\n",
      "was held immovably. O'Brien moved the cage nearer. It was less than a\n",
      "metre from Winston's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I have pressed the first lever,' said O'Brien. 'You understand the\n",
      "construction of this cage. The mask will fit over your head, leaving no\n",
      "exit. When I press this other lever, the door of the cage will slide up.\n",
      "These starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets. Have you ever\n",
      "seen a rat leap through the air? They will leap on to your face and bore\n",
      "straight into it. Sometimes they attack the eyes first. Sometimes they\n",
      "burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The cage was nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard a succession of\n",
      "shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head. But\n",
      "he fought furiously against his panic. To think, to think, even with a\n",
      "split second left--to think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty\n",
      "odour of the brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent convulsion of\n",
      "nausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. Everything had gone\n",
      "black. For an instant he was insane, a screaming animal. Yet he came out\n",
      "of the blackness clutching an idea. There was one and only one way to save\n",
      "himself. He must interpose another human being, the BODY of another human\n",
      "being, between himself and the rats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of\n",
      "anything else. The wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his face. The\n",
      "rats knew what was coming now. One of them was leaping up and down, the\n",
      "other, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pink\n",
      "hands against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. Winston could see\n",
      "the whiskers and the yellow teeth. Again the black panic took hold of him.\n",
      "He was blind, helpless, mindless.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was a common punishment in Imperial China,' said O'Brien as\n",
      "didactically as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed his cheek. And then--no,\n",
      "it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. Too late, perhaps\n",
      "too late. But he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was\n",
      "just ONE person to whom he could transfer his punishment--ONE body that he\n",
      "could thrust between himself and the rats. And he was shouting frantically,\n",
      "over and over.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don't care what you do\n",
      "to her. Tear her face off, strip her to the bones. Not me! Julia! Not me!'\n",
      "\n",
      "He was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away from the rats. He was\n",
      "still strapped in the chair, but he had fallen through the floor, through\n",
      "the walls of the building, through the earth, through the oceans, through\n",
      "the atmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars--always\n",
      "away, away, away from the rats. He was light years distant, but O'Brien\n",
      "was still standing at his side. There was still the cold touch of wire\n",
      "against his cheek. But through the darkness that enveloped him he heard\n",
      "another metallic click, and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and\n",

      "The Chestnut Tree was almost empty. A ray of sunlight slanting through a\n",

      "BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said. Unbidden, a waiter came and\n",
      "filled his glass up with Victory Gin, shaking into it a few drops from\n",

      "\n",
      "Winston was listening to the telescreen. At present only music was coming\n",
      "out of it, but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be\n",
      "a special bulletin from the Ministry of Peace. The news from the African\n",
      "front was disquieting in the extreme. On and off he had been worrying\n",
      "about it all day. A Eurasian army (Oceania was at war with Eurasia:\n",
      "Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia) was moving southward at\n",
      "terrifying speed. The mid-day bulletin had not mentioned any definite\n",
      "area, but it was probable that already the mouth of the Congo was a\n",
      "battlefield. Brazzaville and Leopoldville were in danger. One did not have\n",
      "to look at the map to see what it meant. It was not merely a question of\n",
      "losing Central Africa: for the first time in the whole war, the territory\n",
      "of Oceania itself was menaced.\n",
      "\n",
      "A violent emotion, not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiated\n",
      "excitement, flared up in him, then faded again. He stopped thinking about\n",
      "the war. In these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject for\n",
      "more than a few moments at a time. He picked up his glass and drained it\n",
      "at a gulp. As always, the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly.\n",
      "The stuff was horrible. The cloves and saccharine, themselves disgusting\n",
      "enough in their sickly way, could not disguise the flat oily smell; and\n",
      "what was worst of all was that the smell of gin, which dwelt with him\n",
      "night and day, was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell of\n",
      "those----\n",
      "\n",
      "He never named them, even in his thoughts, and so far as it was possible\n",
      "he never visualized them. They were something that he was half-aware of,\n",
      "hovering close to his face, a smell that clung to his nostrils. As the gin\n",
      "rose in him he belched through purple lips. He had grown fatter since they\n",
      "released him, and had regained his old colour--indeed, more than regained\n",
      "it. His features had thickened, the skin on nose and cheekbones was\n",
      "coarsely red, even the bald scalp was too deep a pink. A waiter, again\n",
      "unbidden, brought the chessboard and the current issue of 'The Times',\n",
      "with the page turned down at the chess problem. Then, seeing that Winston's\n",
      "glass was empty, he brought the gin bottle and filled it. There was no\n",
      "need to give orders. They knew his habits. The chessboard was always\n",
      "waiting for him, his corner table was always reserved; even when the place\n",
      "was full he had it to himself, since nobody cared to be seen sitting too\n",
      "close to him. He never even bothered to count his drinks. At irregular\n",
      "intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said\n",
      "was the bill, but he had the impression that they always undercharged him.\n",
      "It would have made no difference if it had been the other way about. He\n",
      "had always plenty of money nowadays. He even had a job, a sinecure, more\n",
      "highly-paid than his old job had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "The music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over. Winston raised\n",
      "his head to listen. No bulletins from the front, however. It was merely a\n",
      "brief announcement from the Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding quarter,\n",
      "it appeared, the Tenth Three-Year Plan's quota for bootlaces had been\n",
      "overfulfilled by 98 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. It was a tricky\n",
      "ending, involving a couple of knights. 'White to play and mate in two\n",
      "moves.' Winston looked up at the portrait of Big Brother. White always\n",
      "mates, he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. Always, without\n",
      "exception, it is so arranged. In no chess problem since the beginning of\n",
      "the world has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying\n",
      "triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed back at him, full of calm\n",
      "power. White always mates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much\n",
      "graver tone: 'You are warned to stand by for an important announcement at\n",
      "fifteen-thirty. Fifteen-thirty! This is news of the highest importance.\n",
      "Take care not to miss it. Fifteen-thirty!' The tinkling music struck up\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winston's heart stirred. That was the bulletin from the front; instinct\n",
      "told him that it was bad news that was coming. All day, with little spurts\n",
      "of excitement, the thought of a smashing defeat in Africa had been in and\n",
      "out of his mind. He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarming\n",
      "across the never-broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of Africa\n",
      "like a column of ants. Why had it not been possible to outflank them in\n",
      "some way? The outline of the West African coast stood out vividly in his\n",
      "mind. He picked up the white knight and moved it across the board. THERE\n",
      "was the proper spot. Even while he saw the black horde racing southward he\n",
      "saw another force, mysteriously assembled, suddenly planted in their rear,\n",
      "cutting their communications by land and sea. He felt that by willing it he\n",
      "was bringing that other force into existence. But it was necessary to act\n",
      "quickly. If they could get control of the whole of Africa, if they had\n",
      "airfields and submarine bases at the Cape, it would cut Oceania in two. It\n",
      "might mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the redivision of the world, the\n",
      "destruction of the Party! He drew a deep breath. An extraordinary medley\n",
      "of feeling--but it was not a medley, exactly; rather it was successive\n",
      "layers of feeling, in which one could not say which layer was\n",
      "undermost--struggled inside him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spasm passed. He put the white knight back in its place, but for the\n",
      "moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem.\n",
      "His thoughts wandered again. Almost unconsciously he traced with his\n",
      "finger in the dust on the table:\n",

      "'They can't get inside you,' she had said. But they could get inside you.\n",

      "He had seen her; he had even spoken to her. There was no danger in it. He\n",
      "knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his\n",
      "doings. He could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them\n",
      "had wanted to. Actually it was by chance that they had met. It was in the\n",
      "Park, on a vile, biting day in March, when the earth was like iron and\n",
      "all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few\n",
      "crocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind. He\n",
      "was hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not\n",
      "ten metres away from him. It struck him at once that she had changed in\n",
      "some ill-defined way. They almost passed one another without a sign, then\n",
      "he turned and followed her, not very eagerly. He knew that there was no\n",
      "danger, nobody would take any interest in him. She did not speak. She\n",
      "walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him,\n",
      "then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side. Presently they\n",
      "were in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs, useless either for\n",
      "concealment or as protection from the wind. They halted. It was vilely\n",
      "cold. The wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional,\n",
      "dirty-looking crocuses. He put his arm round her waist.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no telescreen, but there must be hidden microphones: besides,\n",
      "they could be seen. It did not matter, nothing mattered. They could have\n",
      "lain down on the ground and done THAT if they had wanted to. His flesh\n",
      "froze with horror at the thought of it. She made no response whatever to\n",
      "the clasp of his arm; she did not even try to disengage herself. He knew\n",
      "now what had changed in her. Her face was sallower, and there was a long\n",
      "scar, partly hidden by the hair, across her forehead and temple; but that\n",
      "was not the change. It was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in a\n",
      "surprising way, had stiffened. He remembered how once, after the explosion\n",
      "of a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins, and\n",
      "had been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing, but by\n",
      "its rigidity and awkwardness to handle, which made it seem more like stone\n",
      "than flesh. Her body felt like that. It occurred to him that the texture\n",
      "of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak. As they walked back\n",
      "across the grass, she looked directly at him for the first time. It\n",
      "was only a momentary glance, full of contempt and dislike. He wondered\n",
      "whether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it\n",
      "was inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept\n",
      "squeezing from his eyes. They sat down on two iron chairs, side by side\n",
      "but not too close together. He saw that she was about to speak. She moved\n",
      "her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig. Her\n",
      "feet seemed to have grown broader, he noticed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I betrayed you,' she said baldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I betrayed you,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave him another quick look of dislike.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sometimes,' she said, 'they threaten you with something something you\n",
      "can't stand up to, can't even think about. And then you say, \"Don't do it\n",
      "to me, do it to somebody else, do it to so-and-so.\" And perhaps you might\n",
      "pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it to\n",
      "make them stop and didn't really mean it. But that isn't true. At the time\n",
      "when it happens you do mean it. You think there's no other way of saving\n",
      "yourself, and you're quite ready to save yourself that way. You WANT it to\n",
      "happen to the other person. You don't give a damn what they suffer. All\n",
      "you care about is yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'All you care about is yourself,' he echoed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And after that, you don't feel the same towards the other person any\n",
      "longer.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No,' he said, 'you don't feel the same.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There did not seem to be anything more to say. The wind plastered their\n",
      "thin overalls against their bodies. Almost at once it became embarrassing\n",
      "to sit there in silence: besides, it was too cold to keep still. She said\n",
      "something about catching her Tube and stood up to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We must meet again,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' she said, 'we must meet again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He followed irresolutely for a little distance, half a pace behind her.\n",
      "They did not speak again. She did not actually try to shake him off, but\n",
      "walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her.\n",
      "He had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the Tube\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Newspeak was the official language of Oceania and had been devised to meet\n",
      "the ideological needs of Ingsoc, or English Socialism. In the year 1984\n",
      "there was not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of\n",
      "communication, either in speech or writing. The leading articles in\n",
      "'The Times' were written in it, but this was a TOUR DE FORCE which could\n",
      "only be carried out by a specialist. It was expected that Newspeak would\n",
      "have finally superseded Oldspeak (or Standard English, as we should\n",
      "call it) by about the year 2050. Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all\n",
      "Party members tending to use Newspeak words and grammatical constructions\n",
      "more and more in their everyday speech. The version in use in 1984, and\n",
      "embodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, was\n",
      "a provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaic\n",
      "formations which were due to be suppressed later. It is with the final,\n",
      "perfected version, as embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary,\n",
      "that we are concerned here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression\n",
      "for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc,\n",
      "but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that\n",
      "when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten,\n",
      "a heretical thought--that is, a thought diverging from the principles of\n",
      "Ingsoc--should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is\n",
      "dependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and\n",
      "often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could\n",
      "properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the\n",
      "possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partly\n",
      "by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable\n",
      "words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and\n",
      "so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. To give a single\n",
      "example. The word FREE still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be\n",
      "used in such statements as 'This dog is free from lice' or 'This field is\n",
      "free from weeds'. It could not be used in its old sense of 'politically\n",
      "free' or 'intellectually free' since political and intellectual freedom no\n",
      "longer existed even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless.\n",
      "Quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction\n",
      "of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could be\n",
      "dispensed with was allowed to survive. Newspeak was designed not to extend\n",
      "but to DIMINISH the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectly\n",
      "assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it, though\n",
      "many Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created words,\n",
      "would be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day. Newspeak\n",
      "words were divided into three distinct classes, known as the A vocabulary,\n",
      "the B vocabulary (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary.\n",
      "It will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical\n",
      "peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to\n",
      "the A vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE A VOCABULARY. The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the\n",
      "business of everyday life--for such things as eating, drinking, working,\n",
      "putting on one's clothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles,\n",
      "gardening, cooking, and the like. It was composed almost entirely of words\n",
      "that we already possess words like HIT, RUN, DOG, TREE, SUGAR, HOUSE,\n",
      "FIELD--but in comparison with the present-day English vocabulary their\n",
      "number was extremely small, while their meanings were far more rigidly\n",
      "defined. All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of\n",
      "them. So far as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word of this class was\n",
      "simply a staccato sound expressing ONE clearly understood concept. It\n",
      "would have been quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary\n",
      "purposes or for political or philosophical discussion. It was intended\n",
      "only to express simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete\n",
      "objects or physical actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities. The first of\n",
      "these was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of\n",
      "speech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied even to very\n",
      "abstract words such as IF or WHEN) could be used either as verb, noun,\n",
      "adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form, when they were\n",
      "of the same root, there was never any variation, this rule of itself\n",
      "involving the destruction of many archaic forms. The word THOUGHT, for\n",
      "example, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place was taken by THINK, which\n",
      "did duty for both noun and verb. No etymological principle was followed\n",
      "here: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention,\n",
      "in other cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning\n",
      "were not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequently\n",
      "suppressed. There was, for example, no such word as CUT, its meaning being\n",
      "sufficiently covered by the noun-verb KNIFE. Adjectives were formed by\n",
      "adding the suffix -FUL to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding -WISE. Thus\n",
      "for example, SPEEDFUL meant 'rapid' and SPEEDWISE meant 'quickly'. Certain\n",
      "of our present-day adjectives, such as GOOD, STRONG, BIG, BLACK, SOFT,\n",
      "were retained, but their total number was very small. There was little\n",
      "need for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by\n",
      "adding -FUL to a noun-verb. None of the now-existing adverbs was retained,\n",
      "except for a very few already ending in -WISE: the -WISE termination was\n",
      "invariable. The word WELL, for example, was replaced by GOODWISE.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, any word--this again applied in principle to every word in\n",
      "the language--could be negatived by adding the affix UN-, or could be\n",
      "strengthened by the affix PLUS-, or, for still greater emphasis,\n",
      "DOUBLEPLUS-. Thus, for example, UNCOLD meant 'warm', while PLUSCOLD and\n",
      "DOUBLEPLUSCOLD meant, respectively, 'very cold' and 'superlatively cold'.\n",
      "It was also possible, as in present-day English, to modify the meaning of\n",
      "almost any word by prepositional affixes such as ANTE-, POST-, UP-, DOWN-,\n",
      "etc. By such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous\n",
      "diminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance, the word GOOD, there was no\n",
      "need for such a word as BAD, since the required meaning was equally\n",
      "well--indeed, better--expressed by UNGOOD. All that was necessary, in any\n",
      "case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide\n",
      "which of them to suppress. DARK, for example, could be replaced by UNLIGHT,\n",
      "or LIGHT by UNDARK, according to preference.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity.\n",
      "Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inflexions\n",
      "followed the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past\n",
      "participle were the same and ended in -ED. The preterite of STEAL was\n",
      "STEALED, the preterite of THINK was THINKED, and so on throughout the\n",
      "language, all such forms as SWAM, GAVE, BROUGHT, SPOKE, TAKEN, etc., being\n",
      "abolished. All plurals were made by adding -S or -ES as the case might be.\n",
      "The plurals OF MAN, OX, LIFE, were MANS, OXES, LIFES. Comparison of\n",
      "adjectives was invariably made by adding -ER, -EST (GOOD, GOODER, GOODEST),\n",
      "irregular forms and the MORE, MOST formation being suppressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly\n",
      "were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and the\n",
      "auxiliary verbs. All of these followed their ancient usage, except that\n",
      "WHOM had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the SHALL, SHOULD tenses had\n",
      "been dropped, all their uses being covered by WILL and WOULD. There were\n",
      "also certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for\n",
      "rapid and easy speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was liable\n",
      "to be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionally\n",
      "therefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word\n",
      "or an archaic formation was retained. But this need made itself felt\n",
      "chiefly in connexion with the B vocabulary. WHY so great an importance was\n",
      "attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE B VOCABULARY. The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been\n",
      "deliberately constructed for political purposes: words, that is to say,\n",
      "which not only had in every case a political implication, but were intended\n",
      "to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. Without\n",
      "a full understanding of the principles of Ingsoc it was difficult to use\n",
      "these words correctly. In some cases they could be translated into\n",
      "Oldspeak, or even into words taken from the A vocabulary, but this usually\n",
      "demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain\n",
      "overtones. The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing\n",
      "whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more\n",
      "accurate and forcible than ordinary language.\n",
      "\n",
      "The B words were in all cases compound words. [Compound words such as\n",
      "SPEAKWRITE, were of course to be found in the A vocabulary, but these were\n",
      "merely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological colour.]\n",
      "They consisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded together\n",
      "in an easily pronounceable form. The resulting amalgam was always a\n",
      "noun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a single\n",
      "example: the word GOODTHINK, meaning, very roughly, 'orthodoxy', or, if\n",
      "one chose to regard it as a verb, 'to think in an orthodox manner'. This\n",
      "inflected as follows: noun-verb, GOODTHINK; past tense and past participle,\n",
      "GOODTHINKED; present participle, GOOD-THINKING; adjective, GOODTHINKFUL;\n",
      "adverb, GOODTHINKWISE; verbal noun, GOODTHINKER.\n",
      "\n",
      "The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan. The words of\n",
      "which they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could be placed\n",
      "in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce\n",
      "while indicating their derivation. In the word CRIMETHINK (thoughtcrime),\n",
      "for instance, the THINK came second, whereas in THINKPOL (Thought Police)\n",
      "it came first, and in the latter word POLICE had lost its second syllable.\n",
      "Because of the great difficulty in securing euphony, irregular formations\n",
      "were commoner in the B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary. For example,\n",
      "the adjective forms of MINITRUE, MINIPAX, and MINILUV were, respectively,\n",
      "MINITRUTHFUL, MINIPEACEFUL, and MINILOVELY, simply because -TRUEFUL,\n",
      "-PAXFUL, and -LOVEFUL were slightly awkward to pronounce. In principle,\n",
      "however, all B words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the\n",
      "same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible to\n",
      "anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole. Consider, for example,\n",
      "such a typical sentence from a 'Times' leading article as OLDTHINKERS\n",
      "UNBELLYFEEL INGSOC. The shortest rendering that one could make of this\n",
      "in Oldspeak would be: 'Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolution\n",

      "the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively, but in Newspeak\n",
      "it was used with a conscious purpose. It was perceived that in thus\n",
      "abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by\n",
      "cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it.\n",
      "The words COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL, for instance, call up a composite\n",
      "picture of universal human brotherhood, red flags, barricades, Karl Marx,\n",
      "and the Paris Commune. The word COMINTERN, on the other hand, suggests\n",
      "merely a tightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of doctrine.\n",
      "It refers to something almost as easily recognized, and as limited in\n",
      "purpose, as a chair or a table. COMINTERN is a word that can be uttered\n",
      "almost without taking thought, whereas COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL is a phrase\n",
      "over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In the same way,\n",
      "the associations called up by a word like MINITRUE are fewer and more\n",
      "controllable than those called up by MINISTRY OF TRUTH. This accounted not\n",
      "only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the\n",
      "almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily\n",
      "pronounceable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude\n",
      "of meaning. Regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it\n",
      "seemed necessary. And rightly so, since what was required, above all for\n",
      "political purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which\n",
      "could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the\n",
      "speaker's mind. The words of the B vocabulary even gained in force from\n",
      "the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. Almost invariably\n",
      "these words--GOODTHINK, MINIPAX, PROLEFEED, SEXCRIME, JOYCAMP, INGSOC,\n",
      "BELLYFEEL, THINKPOL, and countless others--were words of two or three\n",
      "syllables, with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable\n",
      "and the last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at\n",
      "once staccato and monotonous. And this was exactly what was aimed at. The\n",
      "intention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not\n",
      "ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness.\n",
      "For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes\n",
      "necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member called upon to\n",
      "make a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the\n",
      "correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets.\n",
      "His training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost\n",
      "foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound\n",
      "and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of\n",
      "Ingsoc, assisted the process still further.\n",
      "\n",
      "So did the fact of having very few words to choose from. Relative to our\n",
      "own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were\n",
      "constantly being devised. Newspeak, indeed, differed from most all other\n",
      "languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every\n",
      "year. Each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice,\n",
      "the smaller the temptation to take thought. Ultimately it was hoped to\n",
      "make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher\n",
      "brain centres at all. This aim was frankly admitted in the Newspeak word\n",
      "DUCKSPEAK, meaning 'to quack like a duck'. Like various other words in\n",
      "the B vocabulary, DUCKSPEAK was ambivalent in meaning. Provided that the\n",
      "opinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but\n",
      "praise, and when 'The Times' referred to one of the orators of the Party\n",
      "as a DOUBLEPLUSGOOD DUCKSPEAKER it was paying a warm and valued compliment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE C VOCABULARY. The C vocabulary was supplementary to the others and\n",
      "consisted entirely of scientific and technical terms. These resembled the\n",
      "scientific terms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots,\n",
      "but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of\n",
      "undesirable meanings. They followed the same grammatical rules as the\n",
      "words in the other two vocabularies. Very few of the C words had any\n",
      "currency either in everyday speech or in political speech. Any scientific\n",
      "worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted\n",
      "to his own speciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of the\n",
      "words occurring in the other lists. Only a very few words were common to\n",
      "all lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of Science\n",
      "as a habit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its particular\n",
      "branches. There was, indeed, no word for 'Science', any meaning that it\n",
      "could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word INGSOC.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the foregoing account it will be seen that in Newspeak the expression\n",
      "of unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible.\n",
      "It was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a\n",
      "species of blasphemy. It would have been possible, for example, to say\n",
      "BIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD. But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely\n",
      "conveyed a self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by\n",
      "reasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available. Ideas\n",
      "inimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form,\n",
      "and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and\n",
      "condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so.\n",
      "One could, in fact, only use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by\n",
      "illegitimately translating some of the words back into Oldspeak. For\n",
      "example, ALL MANS ARE EQUAL was a possible Newspeak sentence, but only\n",
      "in the same sense in which ALL MEN ARE REDHAIRED is a possible Oldspeak\n",
      "sentence. It did not contain a grammatical error, but it expressed\n",
      "a palpable untruth--i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, or\n",
      "strength. The concept of political equality no longer existed, and this\n",
      "secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word EQUAL.\n",
      "In 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication,\n",
      "the danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words one might\n",
      "remember their original meanings. In practice it was not difficult for\n",
      "any person well grounded in DOUBLETHINK to avoid doing this, but within\n",
      "a couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have\n",
      "vanished. A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no\n",
      "more know that EQUAL had once had the secondary meaning of 'politically\n",
      "equal', or that FREE had once meant 'intellectually free', than for\n",
      "instance, a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the\n",
      "secondary meanings attaching to QUEEN and ROOK. There would be many\n",
      "crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit, simply\n",
      "because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable. And it was to be\n",
      "foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics\n",
      "of Newspeak would become more and more pronounced--its words growing\n",
      "fewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance of\n",
      "putting them to improper uses always diminishing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, the last link with\n",
      "the past would have been severed. History had already been rewritten,\n",

      "It was impossible to translate any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unless\n",
      "it either referred to some technical process or some very simple everyday\n",
      "action, or was already orthodox (GOODTHINKFUL would be the Newspeak\n",
      "expression) in tendency. In practice this meant that no book written before\n",
      "approximately 1960 could be translated as a whole. Pre-revolutionary\n",
      "literature could only be subjected to ideological translation--that is,\n",
